          <MainDescription><![CDATA[<p>
    The communication and collaboration layer is the foundation for OpenUP, reflecting the collaborative nature of the
    process. It contains all of the roles in OpenUP: stakeholder, analyst, developer, architect, tester, project manager,
    and any role. Team members taking on these roles need to collaborate to jointly capture and define the intent of
    the stakeholders, to jointly develop the solution, and to jointly manage the project.
</p>
<p>
    This foundational layer reflects and enables us to express the nature of self-organized teams, where team members must
    broaden their perspectives of what their roles are and where their responsibilities end. As an example, the
    analyst cannot say “I documented the requirements, now it is up to the developer to implement them.” The analyst''s job
    is not primarily to document requirements; it is to communicate that the stakeholder intent is understood and reflected
    in a validated build. Documenting requirements may help you achieve that objective, but it is only one of
    many available tools. Other tools you can use include working with developers on the design, working with testers on what
    needs to be tested, and using the build to ensure that it does what the stakeholders need it to do.
</p>
<p>
    To help the team collaborate effectively, the foundational collaboration layer provides you with a set of
    practices organized by <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../openup/customcategories/core_principles_category_8075133D.html" guid="_UCOtoMXwEduywMSzPTUUwA">core
    principles</a> that have been shown to motivate effective collaboration. These practices apply to work done in the
    other layers too.

    The Intent layer deals with how to channel the intent of stakeholders to the rest of the development team, to ensure
    that validated builds with incremental capabilities reflect stakeholder intents. This is done by capturing and
    communicating the <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../openup/workproducts/vision_2E71B03C.html" guid="_0WVxcMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">vision</a> to all team members, and by translating the vision into test cases and
    requirements of different types. This allows the team to understand what capabilities need to be delivered to address
    stakeholder intent.
</p>
<p>
    You find the most tasks for the Intent layer in the <strong>Requirements</strong> discipline, and the task to
    create test cases in the <strong>Test</strong> discipline. The corresponding work products are found under
    <strong>Requirements</strong> and <strong>Test</strong> domains.
</p>
<p>
    The Intent layer is built upon the foundational <a class="elementLink" href="./../../openup/customcategories/collab_commun_layer_A3CDA6EF.html" guid="_r8cVIEmbEdu0xduwSKie-w">Communication and collaboration layer</a>. That layer constitutes the backbone of OpenUP
    in order to reflect the following:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        All roles in OpenUP are involved in intent development to ensure that, as a minimum, all team members properly
        understand stakeholders’ intent.
    </li>
    <li>
        Make sure that the best practices for collaborative development provided in the collaboration layer guides any work
        related to intent.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The intent layer is written in such a way that your organization can modify it to fit your style of development
    and stakeholder collaboration, without necessarily impacting how you deal with the other layers (<a class="elementLink" href="./../../openup/customcategories/management_layer_DF9A1A7F.html" guid="_Aoz2gEmcEdu0xduwSKie-w">Management layer</a><a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../openup/customcategories/management_layer_DF9A1A7F.html" guid="_Aoz2gEmcEdu0xduwSKie-w"> </a>and <a class="elementLink" href="./../../openup/customcategories/solution_layer_8AA9BF96.html" guid="_HEVvgEmcEdu0xduwSKie-w">Solution layer</a>).

    It is important to note that the Management layer is built on the foundational <a class="elementLink" href="./../../openup/customcategories/collab_commun_layer_A3CDA6EF.html" guid="_r8cVIEmbEdu0xduwSKie-w">Communication and collaboration layer</a> to reflect the collaborative nature of
    managing an OpenUP project. The manager should not plan an iteration in isolation, and then tell the team members
    their assignments. Instead, the manager should be more of a coach, involving the entire team in the planning process to
    ensure that:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Everybody’s knowledge is reflected in the plan
    </li>
    <li>
        All team members estimate their own work

        Each team member signs up to take on a task, rather than being told exactly what to do

<h3>
    What is OpenUP?
</h3>
<p>
    OpenUP is a lean Unified Process that applies iterative and incremental approaches within a structured lifecycle.
    OpenUP embraces a pragmatic, agile philosophy that focuses on the collaborative nature of software development. It is a
    tools-agnostic, low-ceremony process that can be extended to address a broad variety of project types.

    <em>OpenUP layers: micro-increments, iteration lifecycle and project lifecycle</em>
</p>
<p>
    Personal effort on an OpenUP project is organized in <strong>micro-increments</strong>. These represent short units of
    work that produce a steady, measurable pace of project progress (typically measured in hours or a few days). The
    process applies intensive collaboration as the system is incrementally developed by a committed, self-organized team.
    These micro-increments provide an extremely short feedback loop that drives adaptive decisions within each iteration.
</p>
<p>
    OpenUP divides the project into iterations: planned, time-boxed intervals typically measured in weeks. Iterations focus
    the team on delivering incremental value to stakeholders in a predictable manner. The iteration plan defines what
    should be delivered within the iteration, and the result is a demo-able or shippable build. OpenUP teams self-organize
    around how to accomplish iteration objectives and commit to delivering the results. They do that by defining and
    "pulling" fine-grained tasks from a work items list. OpenUP applies an <strong>iteration lifecycle</strong> that
    structures how micro-increments are applied to deliver stable, cohesive builds of the system that incrementally
    progresses towards the iteration objectives.
</p>
<p>
    OpenUP structures the <strong>project lifecycle</strong> into four phases: Inception, Elaboration, Construction, and
    Transition. The project lifecycle provides stakeholders and team members with visibility and decision points throughout
    the project. This enables effective oversight, and allows you to make "go or no-go" decisions at appropriate times. A
    project plan defines the lifecycle, and the end result is a released application.

<ul>
    <li>
        Understand the problem to be solved
    </li>
    <li>
        Understand stakeholder needs (what users want)
    </li>
    <li>
        Define the requirements for the solution (what the system must do)
    </li>
    <li>
        Define the boundaries (scope) of the system

          <MainDescription><![CDATA[<p>
    The purpose of this discipline is to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Provide early and frequent <em>feedback</em> that the system satisfies the requirements
    </li>
    <li>
        Objectively measure progress in small increments
    </li>
    <li>
        Identify issues with the solution
    </li>
    <li>
        Provide assurance that changes to the system do not introduce new defects
    </li>
    <li>
        Improve velocity by facilitating the discovery of issues with requirements, designs, and implementations as early
        as possible
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The Test discipline is iterative and incremental. It applies the strategy of “test early and test often” in order to
    retire risks as early in the system’s lifecycle as possible.
</p>
<p>
    Testing occurs in each iteration of the lifecycle, beginning with the earliest builds of the system. In fact, it’s
    common for one iteration to have many test cycles, depending on the frequency of new builds.
</p>
<p>
    Testing asks the question: “What does the Solution have to <em>do</em> in order for us to consider a requirement
    implemented?” Tests elaborate on the requirements with specific conditions of satisfaction that the Solution must meet.
</p>
<p>
    This discipline challenges the assumptions, risks, and uncertainty inherent in the development of highly technical
    artifacts, and addresses those concerns using concrete demonstration and impartial evaluation.
</p>
<p>
    The Test discipline relates to the other disciplines in the following ways:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="./../../openup/disciplines/requirements.html" guid="_0TR2ZMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">Discipline: Requirements</a>
        identifies the <em>intent</em> of the system. Testing elaborates on the requirements with detailed tests that
        measure how the system supports the requirements.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="./../../openup/disciplines/development.html" guid="_0TeDoMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">Discipline: Development</a>
        creates incremental builds of the system that the Test discipline evaluates. In each iteration, testing provides
        objective feedback. Effective testing enables Developers to focus on implementing new functionality, and improving
        the design of the system.
    </li>

        <a href="./../../openup/disciplines/project_management.html" guid="_0TqQ4MlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">Discipline: Project
        Management</a> plans the overall project, and the scope of work, for each iteration. The Test discipline provides

    The purpose of this discipline is to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Maintain a consistent set of work products as they evolve
    </li>
    <li>
        Maintain consistent builds of the software
    </li>
    <li>
        Provide an efficient means to adapt to changes and issues, and re-plan work accordingly
    </li>
    <li>
        Provide data for measuring progress
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    In many organizations, the term "configuration management" implies all of these things.
</p>
<p>
    Within the context of this process, configuration management refers to the ability to maintain <a class="elementLink" href="./../../openup/guidances/termdefinitions/version_F3A31B17.html" guid="_eX8K8ElyEducWJcS4yanqg">version</a>s of artifacts and consistent <a class="elementLink" href="./../../openup/guidances/termdefinitions/configuration_FE64B3D8.html" guid="__Cw30ElxEducWJcS4yanqg">configuration</a>s of artifacts, addressing the first two objectives listed above.
    Change Management refers to the process of managing changes to configuration-controlled artifacts, addressing the
    latter two objectives listed above.
</p>
<p>
    Although it is important to keep up-to-date versions and configurations of all work products, the primary work products
    of concern are the <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../openup/workproducts/implementation_917CA61E.html" guid="_0YoQcMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">Artifact: Implementation</a> and the <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../openup/workproducts/build_95D7D8FD.html" guid="_0YuXEMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">Artifact: Build</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Changes are managed via the <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../openup/tasks/request_change_A048C387.html" guid="_0mwzEclgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">Task: Request Change</a> and subsequent prioritization and disposition of change requests via the <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../openup/workproducts/work_items_list_39D03CC8.html" guid="_rGNWsCbSEdqh1LYUOGRh2A">Artifact: Work Items List</a>.
</p>
<p>
    This discipline spans the entire lifecycle. Every other discipline relies upon the configuration and change management
    discipline to maintain a consistent, up-to-date, set of work products -- and to prioritize and track changes to those work
    products -- throughout the lifecycle.
</p>
<p>
    Configuration and change management is performed by everyone on the development team. Because of the importance and
    pervasiveness of this discipline, configuration and change management guidance is associated with tasks and work
    products in all other disciplines.
</p>]]></MainDescription>
          <KeyConsiderations><![CDATA[<p>
    It is assumed that the project has some form of configuration management system, such as CVS, to maintain version and
    configuration information, and to enable collaborative system development. Without this, all but the most trivial of
    development will be virtually impossible.

          <MainDescription><![CDATA[<p>
    A <a class="elementLink" href="./../../base_concepts/guidances/termdefinitions/discipline_7667F451.html" guid="_yGUuidnmEdmO6L4XMImrsA">discipline</a> is a collection of <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../base_concepts/guidances/termdefinitions/task_6C1FF051.html" guid="_x459ktnmEdmO6L4XMImrsA">tasks</a> that are
    related to a major "area of concern" within the overall project. Grouping tasks into disciplines is mainly an aid to
    understanding the project from a traditional waterfall perspective. Although it is more common to perform tasks
    concurrently across several disciplines (for example, certain requirements tasks are performed in close coordination
    with analysis and design tasks), separating these tasks into distinct disciplines is simply an effective way to
    organize content, which makes comprehension easier.
</p>
<p>
    Another reason that several tasks are all categorized by the same discipline is that they represent a part in achieving
    a higher goal, or performing work tasks that are all related to each other. Every discipline defines standard ways of
    doing the work it categorizes. Such standard ways are expressed by so-called <b>reference workflows</b> described with
    <a class="elementLink" href="./../../base_concepts/guidances/termdefinitions/capability_pattern_F5DDC5F.html" guid="_2RUJACO4EdqaNq6Ptg8uyA">capability pattern</a>s, which define how the tasks categorized by the discipline work
    together (in the most generic way). These reference workflows are often used for educating and teaching practitioners.
</p>
<p>
    Like other workflows, a discipline''s reference workflow is a semi-ordered sequence of activities, presented as either a
    breakdown structure or an activity diagram performed to achieve a particular result. The "semi-ordered" nature of
    discipline workflows emphasizes that the discipline workflows cannot present the real nuances of scheduling real work,
    for they cannot depict the optionality of activities, or the iterative nature of real projects. Yet they still have
    value as a way for us to understand the process, by breaking it into smaller areas of concern.

          <MainDescription><![CDATA[<p>
    Software is created by people with different interests and skills. A healthy team environment enables effective
    collaboration and requires a culture engaged in creativity and positive change. Roles are the human face of the
    software development process but traditional descriptions can be constraining. New points of view on traditional
    software project roles are needed to leverage collaboration instead of increasing communication channels.
</p>
<p>
    Roles do not represent individual responsibilities over tasks or deliverables but are instead “hats” that people can
    put on when working together. Each role is not limited to describing the primary performer of some task, instead the
    roles include a perspective on collaboration by providing additional performers for each task. Playing one or more of
    these roles can help teams express different points of view when creating a solution. This perspective on roles
    empowers a new generation of software development processes, more focused on people interaction. Nobody does great
    software alone but a team working together can do extraordinary things.

            <MainDescription><![CDATA[<h1>
    Introduction
</h1>
<p>
    Software is created by people with different interests and skills who must work together to create software
    effectively.
</p>
<p>
    Develop practices that foster a healthy team environment. A healthy team environment enables effective collaboration,
    which aligns the interests of project participants (development team, quality assurance, product stakeholders, and
    customers) and helps project participants develop a shared understanding of the project.
</p>
<h1>
    Practices
</h1>
<h2>
    Maintain a common understanding
</h2>
<p>
    Project participants require a common understanding of a project to cooperate effectively. Otherwise, disorder sets in,
    because the team members cannot align their understanding and interests, and will then work with different purposes.
</p>
<p>
    Be proactive communicating and sharing information with project participants. Do not assume that everyone will just
    find what they need to know, or that each person has the same understanding of the project as everyone else. Use work
    products (such as the Vision, Work Items List, and Requirements) to align the understanding between the stakeholders and
    developers. Use the architecture to focus and align the interests of the developers. At the end of each iteration, get
    agreement on whether the iteration goals have been reached and, if not, what actions must be taken.
</p>
<h2>
    Foster a high-trust environment
</h2>
<p>
    People who do not feel safe will not communicate their ideas, take initiative, or admit their ignorance. In these
    low-trust work environments, activities must be laboriously planned in detail, carefully supervised, and extensively
    audited. A team working in a low-trust environment may not be able to keep up with rapid change.
</p>
<p>
    Take actions that foster a high-trust environment:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            <b>Manage by intent.</b> Create an environment where teams manage themselves, and managers serve as
            mentors to teams to help them complete their objectives.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <b>Tear down the walls.</b> Work to remove both the physical and mental barriers that inhibit
            development of a common understanding among project participants.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <b>Walk a mile (or 1.6 kilometers) in someone else''s shoes.</b> Respect and try to understand the
            perspectives of others before criticizing their ideas or responding to their criticism.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <b>Respond to conversations with relevance.</b> People, especially technical workers, often respond
            with argument or disagreement, which leads to rivalry and establishes a pecking order in which only a
            few people contribute to the discussion. Develop and encourage behavior that values curiosity and relevance
            over argument and disagreement.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <b>Always look to yourself first for the source of communication problems.</b> Understand that
            everyone has a perspective that is largely invisible to the individual (although it is often obvious to
            everyone else). Develop the habit of identifying the assumptions and prejudices within you that lead to
            argument or lack of communication. Learn to overcome these in the moment of the conversation. This takes
            practice. There are times when others may be intractable, but often the problem can be addressed by wrestling
            with your own perspective.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <b>Understand the constraints of the workplace culture.</b> Some organizations operate in a way that
            allows people to admit mistakes, ask questions, and experiment. Some organizations limit these expressions, but
            they may change, with time and effort. Some organizations have no tolerance for error, and their workers put
            themselves in danger if they admit mistakes or experiment. Understand your environment and protect yourself
            accordingly. Understand that low-trust organizations have more problems in achieving their goals, and provide a
            less satisfying environment.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>
    Share responsibility
</h2>
<p>
    There may be disadvantages for individuals when they work alone. Communication with the team can become sporadic, and
    then stop. People may get into trouble and not ask for help, or not realize that the team is in trouble and needs their
    help. Their understanding of the project may become misaligned with the rest of the team. In the worse situations,
    trust breaks down as individuals see the team working at different purposes to their interests.
</p>
<p>
    While individuals have primary responsibility for their work products, responsibility for work products is shared.
    Nothing is someone else''s responsibility. This may mean either taking up slack and working with someone who is lagging
    for some reason, or asking for help. Experienced staff should be extra-vigilant and watch over less-experienced staff,
    encouraging them to ask for help if necessary.
</p>
<h2>
    Learn continuously
</h2>
<p>
    Not only is software development a fast-developing field where technical skills rapidly become obsolete, it is also an
    empirical process, where software is developed in a manner that sometimes resembles trial and error. Furthermore,
    software is developed by teams of people who must work together to achieve results.
</p>
<p>
    Continuously develop both your technical and interpersonal skills. Learn from the examples of your colleagues. Take the
    opportunity to be both a student of your colleagues, as well as a teacher to them. Always increase your personal
    ability to overcome your own antagonism toward other team members.
</p>
<h2>
    Organize around the architecture
</h2>
<p>
    As projects grow in size, communication between team members becomes increasingly complex. While all team members
    understand the overall system, they can focus primarily on the one or more subsystems that they are responsible for.
    Organizing around the architecture also helps with communication by providing the team with a common vocabulary and
    shared mental model of the system. Communication between team members becomes increasingly complex.
</p>
<p>
    Organize the team around the architecture, and the vocabulary and a shared mental model of the system. However, be
    careful that individuals and teams organized this way do not form a so-called <i>silo mentality</i>, where they
    focus strictly on their subsystems and become ignorant of the other subsystems.
</p>
<p>
    An architecture that reflects the organization’s structure is not in itself evidence that the team has successfully organized
    around the architecture. If organizations and teams are not organized around the architecture, then the architecture
    will naturally conform to the organization, as a result of political and cultural influences. In the end, the
    architecture and the organization will almost always be a reflection of each other. The goal is to guide team
    organization from the needs of the architecture as much as possible.

            <MainDescription><![CDATA[<h1>
    Introduction
</h1>
<p>
    It is usually not possible to know all stakeholders'' needs, be aware of all project risks, comprehend all project
    technologies, or know how to work with your colleagues. Even if it were possible to know all of these things, they are
    likely to change over the life of the project. Promote practices that allow the team to demonstrate
    incremental value, and to get early and continuous feedback from stakeholders.
</p>
<p>
    The intention behind this principle is to continuously get feedback, and to improve both the product and the process of
    the project team. When you provide structure and create a mindset for continuous feedback and improvement, changes are
    accommodated more easily. In addition, feedback is captured early and often, and high-priority risks are confronted early in the
    project. By constantly identifying and attacking risks, there is more confidence in project progress and quality.
</p>
<p>
    Not only does the product evolve, but the team also finds better ways to work together and get involved with
    stakeholders. The process followed by the team can be adjusted accordingly to leverage lessons learned and adjust
    project pace and needs.
</p>
<h1>
    Practices
</h1>
<h2>
    Develop your project in iterations
</h2>
<p>
    Developing a system in a single, linear pass is difficult, because it makes it expensive to incorporate changes and new
    knowledge. Worse, it can delay the discovery and mitigation of risks, because development efforts are scheduled later
    in the lifecycle.
</p>
<p>
    Divide your project into a series of time-boxed <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../openup/guidances/concepts/iteration_C20B1904.html" guid="_lam4ADkBEduxovfWMDsntw">iterations</a>, and
    plan your project iteratively. This iterative strategy enables you to incrementally deliver capabilities (such as an
    executable, usable subset of implemented and tested requirements) that can be assessed by stakeholders at the end of
    each iteration. This provides rapid and timely feedback loops, so that issues can be addressed and improvements made at
    a lower cost. Also, this is accomplished while you still have sufficient budget and time left to do so, and you have
    not gone so far ahead that major rework is required.
</p>
<p>
    Iterative development enables teams to continuously improve software throughout the development <a href="./../../../openup/deliveryprocesses/openup_lifecycle_2CB8A7DA.html" guid="_0uyGoMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">lifecycle</a>.
</p>
<h2>
    Focus iterations on meeting the next management milestone
</h2>
<p>
    A project can appear to make progress while risks and unresolved issues pile up. Focus on bringing closure to
    important project issues (such as stakeholder concurrence regarding scope, and proving the proposed architecture).
</p>
<p>
    Divide the project into phases (such as <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../openup/guidances/concepts/inception_phase_C4456871.html" guid="_0hmKgBOMEduCNqgZdt_OaA">Inception</a>, <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../openup/guidances/concepts/elaboration_phase_BE880435.html" guid="_2plxwBOMEduCNqgZdt_OaA">Elaboration</a>, <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../openup/guidances/concepts/construction_phase_873B6559.html" guid="_48EKsBOMEduCNqgZdt_OaA">Construction</a> and <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../openup/guidances/concepts/transition_phase_DD5986E5.html" guid="__ca5UBOMEduCNqgZdt_OaA">Transition</a>),
    with each phase having a clearly visible management <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../openup/guidances/concepts/phase_milestones_5678231E.html" guid="_HNxbwMBJEdqSgKaj2SZBmg">milestone</a>. The
    focus of each iteration within a phase is on achieving that milestone.
</p>
<h2>
    Manage risks
</h2>
<p>
    Deferring difficult and risky issues until later in a project significantly increases the risk of project failure. Such
    procrastination may lead to investing in the wrong technologies, a bad design, or a set of requirements that may not
    address stakeholder needs.
</p>
<p>
    Attack <a href="./../../../openup/guidances/concepts/risk_AF5840DA.html" guid="_0bsLgMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">risks</a> early,
    or they will attack you. Continuously identify and prioritize risks, and then devise strategies to mitigate them.
    Determine the focus of iterations based on risks. For example, architecturally significant risks should be addressed
    early in the project, no later than the end of the Elaboration phase, when the architecture has been proven and baselined.
</p>
<p>
    Fore more information, see <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../../openup/guidances/guidelines/risk_management_B1256EB4.html" guid="_VNxL4ACsEdu8m4dIntu6jA">Guideline: Managing Risks</a>.
</p>
<h2>
    Embrace and manage change
</h2>
<p>
    Change is inevitable, and while change presents opportunities to enhance stakeholder value, unconstrained change will
    result in a bloated, deficient system and unmet stakeholder needs. Furthermore, the later in the development cycle a
    change is made, the more the change is likely to cost.
</p>
<p>
    Embrace and manage change. Embracing change helps you to build a system that addresses stakeholder needs, and managing
    change allows you to reduce costs and improve predictability of those changes. Changes made early in the project can
    usually be made with limited cost. As you progress in your project, changes can become increasingly costly.
</p>
<p>
    To satisfy customer needs, you typically need to introduce changes to the project, but the customer must be made aware
    of the impact that those changes have on the project cost and schedule. Understand the impact of a change in the
    current phase, and isolate team members from disruptive changes during the current iteration. Change requests are
    reviewed and prioritized during the current iteration, but are not acted upon until assigned to a future iteration.
</p>
<p>
    If necessary, document the changes. For informal projects, a discussion with stakeholders may be enough.
</p>
<h2>
    Measure progress objectively
</h2>
<p>
    If you do not objectively know how your project is progressing, you do not really know if it is failing or succeeding.
    Uncertainty and change make a software project’s progress difficult to measure objectively, and people are prone to
    making objective assessments from subjective information.
</p>
<p>
    Get a clear picture of project status by objectively measuring progress. The best measure of progress is the delivery
    of working software, which is something that you do by taking an evolutionary approach. You can also define a set of objective <a href="./../../../openup/guidances/concepts/metrics_37698708.html" guid="_0mYYkMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">metrics</a> to collect
    during an iteration (for example, requirements that were implemented and validated, number of defects issued compared
    with number fixed) and review them as part of the <a href="./../../../openup/tasks/assess_results_EC34D88D.html" guid="_0l53cMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">iteration assessment</a>. 
</p>
<h2>
    Continuously re-evaluate what you do
</h2>
<p>
    On a regular basis, ask questions and verify assumptions about the project. Regularly meet with the team to track
    status and identify risks and issues. This can be done daily when the team gathers to share the status of individual
    responsibilities and identify and address issues. At the end of iterations, <a href="./../../../openup/tasks/assess_results_EC34D88D.html" guid="_0l53cMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">assess the status</a> of what has been done and look for areas of improvement that can
    be addressed in the next iteration. Have a retrospective review at the end of the project and capture lessons learned
    to run future projects in a more efficient way.
</p>
<p>
    If we always challenge what we do and seek new, innovative ways to develop software, we improve how we work. This leads
    to improved project results.

    Introduction
</h1>
<p>
    The architecture of a software system is the organization or structure of the system''s significant components
    interacting through interfaces, with components composed of successively smaller components and interfaces.
</p>
<p>
    Without an architectural foundation, a system will evolve in an inefficient and haphazard way. Such a system often
    proves difficult to extend, reuse, or integrate without substantial rework. It is also difficult to organize the team,
    or to communicate ideas without the <b>common technical focus</b> that the architecture provides.
</p>
<p>
    Focus on the architecture early to minimize risks and organize development.
</p>
<h1>
    Practices
</h1>
<h2>
    Create the architecture for what you know today
</h2>
<p>
    As Albert Einstein said, make everything as simple as possible, but no simpler. Software projects are
    resource-constrained, and the desire of developers to create elegant solutions may lead to a system of greater
    complexity than the stakeholder requires. Efforts to future-proof a system in a turbulent or uncertain environment will
    likely lead to code bloat, which increases overall costs and complexity with few real benefits.
</p>
<p>
    Create architectures that address the stakeholder’s real needs, and provide appropriate flexibility and speed for the
    requirements as they are known today. Avoid the desire, no matter how well-intentioned, to speculate on future
    requirements and thereby over-engineer the architecture. There is a distinction between over-architecting and building
    an architecture that is flexible and extensible. For example, there may not be an apparent reason
    for creating three architectural layers in a system, but it is probable that the system will grow in ways one
    can''t predict, so we should architect for that. 
</p>
<h2>
    Leverage the architecture as a collaborative tool
</h2>
<p>
    Lack of a common understanding by developers about a system leads to indecision and contrary opinions among developers,
    and can quickly paralyze the project. Developers may have different mental models of the system and work at cross
    purposes to each other.
</p>
<p>
    Create and evolve the system architecture with the intention of using it to align the developers'' competing mental
    models of the system. A good architecture facilitates collaboration by providing a common vocabulary for all
    discussions regarding the system under development.
</p>
<h2>
    Cope with complexity by raising the level of abstraction
</h2>
<p>
    Software is complex, and people have a limited capacity for coping with complexity. As a system gets larger, it is
    difficult for the team to develop a common understanding of the system, because it''s hard to see the bigger
    picture.
</p>
<p>
    Use models to raise the level of abstraction to focus on important high-level decisions, such as relationships and
    patterns, rather than getting bogged down in details. Modeling raises the level of abstraction, and allows the system to
    be more easily understood from different perspectives.
</p>
<h2>
    Organize the architecture into loosely coupled, highly cohesive components
</h2>
<p>
    Tight coupling between components makes a system fragile and difficult to understand. Software is expensive to create,
    so if existing components can be reused, that may reduce effort required to create a system.
</p>
<p>
    Organize the architecture of the system into components to maximize cohesion and minimize coupling. This improves
    comprehension, and increases flexibility and opportunities for re-use.
</p>
<h2>
    Reuse existing assets
</h2>
<p>
    It is wasteful to build what you can simply reuse, download, or even buy.
</p>
<p>
    Make every effort to reuse existing assets. Developers are often reluctant to reuse assets, because those assets do not
    exactly meet their needs, or those assets are of poor quality. Be prepared to balance the savings you can realize using
    an existing asset, even if the asset requires you to make some accommodation in the architecture or relax a constraint.

            <MainDescription><![CDATA[<h1>
    Introduction
</h1>
<p>
    Systems are rarely all things to all people. Often, attempts to make them so are wasteful, and result in bloated
    systems.
</p>
<p>
    To be successful, stakeholders and the project participants must converge on a clear understanding and agreement of
    these three factors:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Problem to be solved
    </li>
    <li>
        Constraints placed on the development team (cost, schedule, resources, regulations, and so on)
    </li>
    <li>
        Constraints placed on the solution
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The challenge for all project participants is creating a solution that maximizes the value delivered to the
    stakeholders, subject to the constraints. Balance is about making the critical, cost-benefit trade-offs between desired
    features and the subsequent design decisions that define the architecture of the system.
</p>
<p>
    Discovering the balance point is challenging, elusive, and ongoing, because the balance point is dynamic. As the system
    evolves, stakeholder needs change, new opportunities appear, risks are resolved, new risks appear, and the development
    team discovers new realities about the system. Change happens throughout the development cycle. Stakeholders
    and team members must be prepared to re-evaluate commitments, reset expectations, and adjust plans
    accordingly as the system evolves.
</p>
<h1>
    Practices
</h1>
<h2>
    Know your audience
</h2>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        You cannot know how to make effective trade-offs if you do not know who the stakeholders are and what they really
        want.
    </p>
    <p>
        Get to know your stakeholders. Better yet, work closely with them to ensure that you know their needs. Start
        by identifying all stakeholders, and then maintain open and frequent communication and collaboration between them
        and the development team.
    </p>
</blockquote>
<h2>
    Separate the problem from the solution
</h2>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        Too often, we run headlong into a solution without understanding the problem. After all, we are taught how to solve
        problems, not how to define problems, so that''s easier. However, this limits your understanding of the problem,
        imposes artificial constraints, and makes it difficult to balance trade-offs, or to even know what the
        trade-offs are.
    </p>
    <p>
        Make sure that you understand the problem before you define the solution. By clearly separating the problem (what
        the customer needs) from the solution (what the system must do), it is easier to maintain the proper focus, and
        easier to accommodate alternate ways of solving the problem.
    </p>
</blockquote>
<h2>
    Create a shared understanding of the domain
</h2>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        Domain experts often have limited technical expertise; developers, architects, and testers often have limited domain
        expertise; and reviewers and other stakeholders often have limited time to commit to the project and learn the
        problem domain. As a result, people often have an inconsistent or poor understanding of the problem domain, which
        causes communication problems and increases the likelihood of delivering poor value to the stakeholders.
    </p>
    <p>
        Enhance and share all parties’ understandings of the domain. A concise and shared understanding of the problem
        domain enhances communication and project effectiveness. Start by defining the problem in the Vision document. As
        your understanding increases, capture key domain concepts and terminology in the Glossary to ensure a consistent,
        shared use of the language of the domain.
    </p>
</blockquote>
<h2>
    Use scenarios and use cases to capture requirements
</h2>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        Many companies still document requirements as a list of declarative statements, which are sometimes called the
        ”shall statements.” These lists are often difficult for stakeholders to understand, because they require the end
        user to read through and mentally translate the list into a visualization of how the requirements will interact
        with the system.
    </p>
    <p>
        Make use of scenarios and use cases to capture functional requirements in a form that is easy for stakeholders
        to understand. Nonfunctional requirements, such as performance, stability, or usability requirements, are important
        and can be documented as supporting requirements, using traditional techniques.
    </p>
</blockquote>
<h2>
    Establish and maintain agreement on priorities
</h2>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        Making poor decisions in deciding what to develop next can result in wasted effort, delivering capabilities that
        are never used, or identifying problems late in the project (resulting in delays and even project failure).
    </p>
    <p>
        Prioritize requirements for implementation by regularly working with the stakeholders during product evolution.
        Make choices that deliver value and reduce risks, while building a system that can evolve.
    </p>
</blockquote>
<h2>
    Make trade-offs to maximize value
</h2>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        Cost-benefit trade-offs cannot be made independent of the architecture. Requirements establish the benefits of the
        system to the stakeholder, while architecture establishes the cost. The cost of a benefit may influence the
        stakeholder''s perceived value of the benefit.
    </p>
    <p>
        Work with the stakeholders and team members to prioritize requirements and develop candidate
        architectures to implement those solutions. Use the candidate architectures to evaluate the cost of the benefits.
        Candidate solutions are considered at a high level when determining architectural feasibility. Different
        architectural perspectives can result in different assessments of cost versus benefit. The candidate
        architecture that provides the most coverage at the lowest cost is selected for further development.
    </p>
</blockquote>
<h2>
    Manage scope
</h2>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        Change is inevitable. Although change presents opportunities to enhance stakeholder value, unconstrained change
        will result in a bloated, deficient system and unmet stakeholder needs.
    </p>
    <p>
        Manage change while maintaining agreements with the stakeholders. Modern processes always manage change,
        continually adapting to changes in the environment and stakeholder needs, assessing the impact of changes, making
        trade-offs, and re-prioritizing work. Stakeholder and developer expectations must be realistic and aligned
        throughout the development lifecycle.
    </p>
</blockquote>
<h2>
    Know when to stop
</h2>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        Over-engineering a system not only wastes resources, but also leads to an overly complex system.
    </p>
    <p>
        Stop developing the system when the desired quality is achieved. Remember that “Quality is conformance to the
        requirements” <a href="./../../../openup/guidances/supportingmaterials/references_6CCF393.html#CRO79" guid="_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg">[CRO79]</a>. This is what gives a sense of closure to the practice. Separate the
        problem from the solution, ensuring that the solution does, indeed, solve the problem. After the critical
        requirements are implemented and validated, the system is ready for stakeholder acceptance.
    </p>

          <MainDescription><![CDATA[<h1> Overview of OpenUP</h1>
<p> OpenUP is for small teams who work together in the same location. The team 
  needs to engage in plenty of daily face-to-face interaction. Team members include 
  the stakeholders, developers, architects, project manager, and testers. They 
  make their own decisions about what they need to work on, what the priorities 
  are, and how best to address stakeholder needs. The organization must support 
  the team by allowing them these responsibilities. </p>
<p> Team members collaborate extensively. The presence of stakeholders as team 
  members is critical to successfully implementing OpenUP. </p>
<p>
    Team members participate in daily stand-up meetings to communicate status and issues. Problems are addressed outside of
    the daily meetings.
</p>
<p> OpenUP focuses on significantly&nbsp;reducing risk early in the lifecycle. 
  This requires regular risk review meetings and rigorous implementation of mitigation 
  strategies. </p>
<p> All work is listed, tracked, and assigned through the Work Items List. Team 
  members use this single repository for all tasks that need to be recorded and 
  tracked. This includes all change requests, bugs, and stakeholder requests. 
</p>
<p> Use cases are used to elicit and describe requirements; therefore, team members 
  need to develop skills in writing good use cases. Stakeholders are responsible 
  for reviewing and certifying that the requirements are correct. Use cases are 
  developed collaboratively. </p>
<p> Architecturally significant requirements must be identified and stabilized 
  in the Elaboration phase so that a robust architecture can be created as the 
  core of the system. An architecturally significant requirement change that must 
  be addressed may arise later in development, but the risk of this happening 
  is significantly reduced in the Elaboration iteration. </p>
<p> Testing is performed multiple times per iteration, every time the solution 
  is incremented with the development of a requirement, change, or bug fix. These 
  tests happen after developers have developed the solution (which should have 
  been unit-tested) and integrate it into the code base. These tests help guarantee 
  that a stable build is created and always available as development progresses. 
</p>
<p> OpenUP does not include content for deployment, configuration management, 
  or the development environment (such as customizing this process or setting 
  up development environments). OpenUP focuses on a singe team, and these areas 
  are generally addressed at an organizational or enterprise level. Look for extensions 
  to OpenUP that address these wider areas. </p>
<p>
    OpenUP is an iterative software development process that is minimal, complete, and extensible. It is governed by four

        How&nbsp;to get started?
    </h4>
    <p>
        The fourth OpenUP core principle, "Evolve to continuously obtain feedback and improve", suggests an iterative and
        incremental approach to adopting OpenUP.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Start with the core principles and understand the intentions behind OpenUP.
        </li>
        <li>
            Then assess your existing process, and select one or two key areas that you would like to improve.
        </li>
        <li>
            Begin using OpenUP to improve these areas first.
        </li>
        <li>
            In later iterations or development cycles, make incremental improvements in other areas.
        </li>
        <li>
            If you have little or no experience with unified processes or other iterative processes, use OpenUP in a small
            pilot project, perhaps with only three to four people working for only two to three months.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        While OpenUP is a ready to use as-is, you may choose to extend the process or modify the work product templates to
        suit your specific needs. For example:

    <ul>
        <li>
            You may require more or less precision in your work products.
        </li>
        <li>
            Your organization may have specific configuration management practices or safety protocols to include in your
            process.
        </li>
        <li>
            You may simply want to put your own corporate logo on the banner.
        </li>
        <li>
            You may want to incorporate lessons learned from a retrospective review into OpenUP.

    The purpose in this phase is to achieve concurrence among all stakeholders on the lifecycle objectives for the
    project, and to make a go/no-go decision.
</p>
<p>
    There are four objectives of the Inception phase that clarify the scope, project objectives, and feasibility of the
    intended solution <a class="elementlinkwithusertext" href="./../../../openup/guidances/supportingmaterials/references_6CCF393.html#KRO03" guid="_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg">[KRO03]</a>:

<p>
    Projects may have one or more iterations in the Inception phase. Among reasons for multiple iterations in Inception,
    you find:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Unprecedented system
    </li>
    <li>
        Too many stakeholders with competing needs and complex relationships
    </li>
    <li>
        Major risks demand the creation of a prototype or proof of concept

    The purpose of this phase is to mitigate technical and non-technical risks. Technical risks are typically addressed by
    establishing the baseline of an executable architecture of the system and providing a stable basis for the bulk of the
    development effort in the next phase. Non-technical risks are addressed by delivering key capabilities in close
    collaboration with stakeholders, allowing us to answer questions such as:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Does stakeholder A concur with the usage paradigm as implemented by the first delivered scenarios?
    </li>
    <li>
        Can we leverage this open source component?
    </li>
    <li>
        Can we acquire this commercial component?
    </li>
    <li>
        Do we have personnel with the appropriate competency?
    </li>
    <li>
        Have we validated that the team can collaborate effectively to deliver working software?
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    There are objectives for the Elaboration phase that help you address risks associated with requirements, architecture,
    costs, and schedule, among others&nbsp;<a class="elementlinkwithusertext"
    href="./../../../openup/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.html#KRO03"
    guid="_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg">[KRO03]</a>:&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Get a more detailed understanding of the requirements.</strong> Having a good understanding of the
            majority of requirements allows you to create a more accurate plan and to get buy-in from stakeholders. Be sure
            to gain an in-depth understanding of the most critical requirements to be validated by the architecture. This
            does not mean that every use case needs to be detailed, but that you have detailed key use cases, and
            understand remaining use cases well enough to size them.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Design, implement, validate, and establish the baseline for the architecture.</strong> Design,
            implement, and test a skeleton structure of the system by designing, implementing, and testing a small number
            of critical scenarios. Although the functionality is not complete yet, most of the interfaces between the
            building blocks are implemented and tested, and the type of architecture and required architectural mechanisms
            are identified. This result is referred&nbsp;as <strong>an executable architecture</strong>.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Mitigate essential risks, and produce accurate schedule and cost estimates.</strong> Many technical
            risks are addressed as a result of detailing the requirements and of designing, implementing, and testing the
            architecture. You may also have to address non-technical risks, such as legal and financial issues related to
            usage of open source or commercial components. Refine and detail the high-level project plan.
        </p>
    </li>
</ol>
<h4>
    Key considerations
</h4>
<p>
    The number of iterations in the Elaboration phase is dependent on, but not limited to, factors such as green-field
    development versus maintenance cycle, unprecedented system versus well-known technology and architecture, and so on.
</p>
<p>
    A maintenance project may for example combine Inception and Elaboration into one iteration that may be only a few days
    long, since the objectives of these phases can be rapidly addressed.
</p>
<p>
    A new unprecedented system may require several iterations to establish and baseline an executable architecture, and to
    address all non-technical issues. For such a project, you start by designing, implementing, and testing a small number
    of critical scenarios, in order to identify what type of architecture and architectural mechanisms you need. You also
    detail high-risk requirements that have to be addressed early in the project. You test enough to validate that the
    architectural risks are mitigated. In later Elaboration iterations, you fix whatever was not right from the previous
    iteration, and design, implement, and test the remaining architecturally significant scenarios, ensuring that you check
    all major areas of the system (architectural coverage), so potential hidden risks arise as early as possible.<br />

    The purpose in this phase is to cost-effectively develop a feature-complete product (an operational version of your
    system) that can be deployed in the user community <a class="elementlinkwithusertext" href="./../../../openup/guidances/supportingmaterials/references_6CCF393.html#KRO03" guid="_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg">[KRO03]</a>.

<p>
    The following objectives for the Construction phase help you accomplish that goal:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p>
            <b>Iteratively develop a complete product that is ready to transition to its user community</b>.
            Describe the remaining requirements, fill in design details, complete the implementation, and test the software.
            Release incremental alpha and beta version of the system, and determine if users are ready for the application to be
            deployed. Further tuning and preparation for final deployment is expected in the <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../openup/guidances/concepts/transition_phase_DD5986E5.html" guid="__ca5UBOMEduCNqgZdt_OaA">Transition Phase</a>. 
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <b>Minimize development costs and achieve some degree of parallelism</b>. Optimize resources and
            leverage development parallelism between developers or teams of developers by, for example, assigning
            components that can be developed independently of one another.
        </p>

    The purpose of this phase is to ensure that the software is ready for delivery to users.
</p>
<p>

    quality of the beta product from the end of the previous phase <a class="elementlinkwithusertext" href="./../../../openup/guidances/supportingmaterials/references_6CCF393.html#KRO03" guid="_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg">[KRO03]</a>:

        <p>
            <b>Beta test to validate that user expectations are met.</b> This typically requires some fine-tuning
            activities, such as bug-fixing and making enhancements for performance and usability.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <b>Achieve stakeholder concurrence that deployment is complete.</b> This may involve various levels
            of tests for product acceptance, including formal and informal tests and beta tests.
        </p>

    <li>
        <p>
            <b>Improve future project performance through lessons learned.</b> Document lessons learned and
            improve the process and tool environment for the project.
        </p>
    </li>
</ol>
<h4>
    <br />
    Key considerations<br />
</h2>
<p>
    The Transition phase can include running old and new systems in parallel, migrating data, training users, and adjusting
    business processes.
</p>
<p>
    The number of iterations in the Transition phase varies from one iteration (for a simple system requiring primarily
    minor bug fixing) to many iterations (for a complex system involving adding features and performing activities) to
    make the business transition from using the old system to using the new system.
</p>
<p>
    When the Transition phase objectives are met, the project is in a position to be closed. For some products, the end
    of the current project lifecycle may coincide with the beginning of the next lifecycle, leading to the next generation
    of the same product.

          <MainDescription><![CDATA[<p>
    Supporting Requirements and Use Cases, together, define the system requirements. Use Cases describe the behavioral
    requirements for the system, and Supporting Requirements describe system-wide requirements that are not captured within
    the Use-Case Specifications. Making this distinction simplifies maintenance.
</p>
<p>
    Supporting Requirements may be categorized according to the FURPS+ model (Functional, Usability, Reliability,
    Performance, Supportability + Constraints). For more information on this classification, see <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../openup/guidances/concepts/supporting_requirements_B2C4D610.html" guid="_VXZ5wO0IEdqHTdbLTmC5IQ">Concept: Supporting Requirements</a>.
</p>
<p>
    The figure that follows illustrates the relationship among the Supporting Requirements, Use-Case Specifications, and
    Actors.

    The goal of this work product is to make sure that all types of requirements are covered, which reduces the risk of not&#xD;
    considering some important facet of the system. FURPS+ requirements are system-wide, and they influence the&#xD;
    Architectural Mechanisms that you will create, thus guiding development of the system''s foundation. These requirements&#xD;
    are frequently the major cost item, because they determine architectural choices.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Furthermore, if you do not capture system-wide requirements in a central location, but repeat them throughout the Use&#xD;
    Cases, the result will be more maintenance and more chance for error.&#xD;

    This artifact provides a focal point for the entire team:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        It provides one list containing all requests for additional capabilities or enhancement for that application. Note
        that some of these requests may never be implemented, or be implemented in later projects
    </li>
    <li>
        It provides one list of all the work to be prioritized, estimated, and assigned within the project. The risk list
        is prioritized separately.
    </li>
    <li>
        It provides one place to go to for the development team to understand what <a class="elementLink"
        href="./../../openup/guidances/concepts/micro_increments.html"
        guid="_S80VwCNbEdyCq8v2ZO4QcA">Micro-Increments</a>&nbsp;need to be delivered, get references to material required
        to carry out the work, and one place to go to report progress made.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    These are the typical work items that go into this list:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Use cases (and references to use-case specifications)
    </li>
    <li>
        Supporting requirements
    </li>
    <li>
        Changes and enhancement requests
    </li>
    <li>
        Defects
    </li>
    <li>
        Development tasks
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Work items can be very large in scope, especially when capturing requests for enhancements, such as “Support Financial
    Planning” for a personal finance application. To allow the application to be developed in micro-increments, work items
    are analyzed and broken down into smaller work items so they can be assigned to an iteration, such as a use-case
    scenario for&nbsp;“Calculate Net Worth”. Further breakdown may be required to identify suitable tasks to be assigned to
    developers, such as “Develop UI for Calculate Net Worth”. This means that work items often have parent/child
    relationships, where the lowest level is a specification and tracking device for micro-increments.

    The main objectives of the iteration plan is to provide the team with one central place for information regarding
    iteration objectives, detailed plan with task assignments, and evaluation results. This artifact also helps the team to
    monitor the progress of the iteration and keeps the results of the iteration assessment that may be usefull for
    improving the next one.
</p>
<p>
    The task assignments for an iteration is a subset of all tasks on the <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../openup/workproducts/work_items_list_39D03CC8.html" guid="_rGNWsCbSEdqh1LYUOGRh2A">Artifact: Work Items List</a>, therefore the iteration plan ideally references those work items.
</p>]]></MainDescription>
          <KeyConsiderations><![CDATA[<p>

    Work items assigned to an iteration do not necessarily have the same priority. When selecting work items from the Work

    Items List, the iteration plan may end up having work items with different priorities (for example, you assign the

    remaining high priority work items, plus a few mid priority ones from the Work Items List). No matter what previous

    priorities the work items had, when assigned to an iteration&nbsp;the team has to make sure they are able to develop

    what has been&nbsp;assigned to the&nbsp;iteration, and deciding on&nbsp;what to&nbsp;develop first (or

    even&nbsp;develop things in parallel) on an iteration will vary from project to project, from iteration to iteration.

some of them may be implemented in a future project, and some of them may never be implemented. 
<p>
    Some of the Work Items may still be poorly defined; therefore, it could represent a big chunk of work, requiring
    potentially several staff months of effort. As the priority of these Work Items increases, they are typically
    decomposed into smaller work items that represent specific and well-defined tasks that may take hours or days to
    address, see <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../openup/guidances/concepts/micro_increments.html"
    guid="_S80VwCNbEdyCq8v2ZO4QcA">Micro-Increments</a>. In other cases, specific and well-defined Work Items are created
    directly, representing, for example, a defect to be addressed, as this figure illustrates.

<p>
    A Work Item may represent work associated with a defect, enhancement request, change request, use case, scenario, user
    story, supporting requirement, stakeholder request, or anything else that captures a potential requirement or
    improvement to your system. A Work Item may reference any type of requirement or other useful information that guides
    you in what needs to be done.
</p>
<p>
    A big advantage with the <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../../openup/workproducts/work_items_list-3.html"
    guid="_rGNWsCbSEdqh1LYUOGRh2A">Artifact: Work Items List</a>&nbsp;is that it enables you to prioritize only one list
    containing all of the things that may need to be addressed, whether the Work Item represent a work related to a
    requirement, enhancement, or defect. The one exception is that we prioritize the risk list separately.
</p>
<p>
    Nothing in the project will get done if not represented or mapped to a Work Item. This means that all requirements,
    defect reports, and change requests have to be mapped to a Work Item at some stage. Also, a developer will not take on
    work that is not represented in a Work Item. Only Work Items needs to be prioritized. This also means that tracking
    Work Items are a primary means of understanding the status of the project.
</p>
<p>
    There are two major types of Work Items:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Unscheduled Work Items:</strong> These Work Items have not yet been assigned to an iteration, and there is
        no detailed effort estimate for the Work Item yet.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Scheduled Work Items:</strong> These Work Items are assigned to an iteration, and they typically have an
        additional set of attributes filled in, such as detailed effort estimates.
    </li>
</ul>
<h1>
    Unscheduled Work Items
</h1>
<p>
    Most Work Items are initially unscheduled, meaning that it has not yet been decided whether to do them and when to do
    them. Unscheduled Work Items should always represent something meaningful to deliver to stakeholders, such a scenario
    to be detailed, designed, implemented, and tested. You may consider capturing the following data for such Work Items:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Name
    </li>
    <li>
        Description
    </li>
    <li>
        Priority
    </li>
    <li>
        Size estimate, such as a point estimate (see <a class="elementLinkWithType"
        href="./../../../openup/guidances/guidelines/agile_estimation.html" guid="_CGHskBEdEdqY7JB6N6CW2w">Guideline: Agile
        Estimation</a>)
    </li>
    <li>
        State, such as New, Assigned, Resolved, Verified, Closed (see Work Items states, which follows here)
    </li>
    <li>
        Links to other reference material, such as requirements or detailed specifications of what needs to be done
    </li>
</ul>
<h1>
    Scheduled Work Items
</h1>
<p>
    After a Work Item has been assigned to an iteration, it becomes <i>scheduled</i>. We assign Work Items only to the
    current or next iteration. There is no point in assigning Work Items to a specific future iteration, since we cannot
    predict what a meaningful schedule will be more than an iteration in advance (see <a class="elementLinkWithType"
    href="./../../../openup/guidances/guidelines/iteration_planning.html" guid="_0auiMMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">Guideline:
    Iteration Planning</a>).
</p>
<p>
    The following additional attributes are useful for Scheduled Work Items:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Target iteration
    </li>
    <li>
        Responsible team member
    </li>
    <li>
        Effort estimate left, such as actual hours of work (see <a class="elementLinkWithType"
        href="./../../../openup/guidances/guidelines/agile_estimation.html" guid="_CGHskBEdEdqY7JB6N6CW2w">Guideline: Agile
        Estimation</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        Hours worked
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    This provides the information required to plan and manage an iteration. We can plan iterations by understanding effort
    involved, and we can <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../../openup/guidances/reports/iteration_burndown.html"
    guid="_uAzgkDg3Edu4E8ZdmlYjtA">Report: Iteration Burndown</a> by tracking how much work is left to do.
</p>
<h1>
    Work Item states
</h1>
<p>
    We have found the following states to be useful for tracking Work Items:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>New:</b> Work Item has been created, but not yet assigned to a team member.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Assigned:</b> A team member has been identified as responsible for the Work Item.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Resolved:</b> The team member responsible for the Work Items has implemented and tested the Work Item.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Verified:</b> The Work Item has been independently tested.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Closed:</b> The Work Item is no longer active.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    You may choose another set of states, based on your needs.

          <MainDescription><![CDATA[<h3>
    Definition
</h3>
<p>
    Supporting requirements are requirements that&nbsp;define necessary system quality attributes&nbsp;such as performance,
    usability and reliability, as well as global functional requirements&nbsp;that are not captured in behavioral
    requirements artifacts such as use-cases.
</p>
<h3>
    Supporting Requirements Categories
</h3>
<p>
    Supporting requirements are categorized according to the FURPS+ model (Functional, Usability, Reliability, Performance,
    Supportability + constraints). Constraints&nbsp;include design, implementation, interfaces, physical constraints, and
    business rules. A description of each of these types of requirements follows.
</p>
<p>
    Supporting requirements and Use Cases, together, define the requirements of the system. These requirements support the
    features listed in the Vision statement. Each requirement should&nbsp;support at least one feature, and each feature
    should be supported by at least one to requirement.
</p>
<p>
    In general, <strong>functional</strong> requirements describe behavior and are captured in&nbsp;Use Cases (see&nbsp;<a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../../openup/workproducts/use_case_22BE66E2.html" guid="_0VGbUMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">Artifact: Use Case</a>). <strong>Non-functional</strong> requirements are captured in
    the <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../../openup/workproducts/supporting_requirements_spec_7D9DD47C.html" guid="_BVh9cL-CEdqb7N6KIeDL8Q">Artifact: Supporting Requirements Specification</a>. However, nonfunctional requirements that are
    closely associated with a particular Use Case are often captured within the Use Case itself to simplify communication
    and maintenance.&nbsp; Similarly, there are global, or system-wide, functional requirements that are often captured
    among the supporting requirements for the same reasons.&nbsp;
</p>
<h4>
    Functional requirements
</h4>
<p>
    Functionality requirements include all the overarching, system wide functional requirements. These functional
    requirements represent the main system features that are familiar within the business domain or technically oriented
    requirements such as auditing, licensing, localization, mail, online help, printing, reporting, security, system
    management, or workflow.
</p>
<h4>
    Usability requirements
</h4>
<p>
    Usability requirements include requirements based on human factors and user interface issues such as accessibility,
    interface aesthetics, and consistency within the user interface.
</p>
<h4>
    Reliability requirements
</h4>
<p>
    Reliability requirements include aspects such as availability, accuracy, predictability, frequency of failure or
    recoverability of the system from shut-down failure.
</p>
<h4>
    Performance requirements
</h4>
<p>
    Performance requirements address concerns such as throughput of information through the system, system response time
    and resource usage.
</p>
<h4>
    Supportability requirements
</h4>
<p>
    Supportability requirements include requirements such as compatibility and the abilities to test, adapt, maintain,
    configure, install, scale, localize, and so on.
</p>
<h4>
    + Constraints
</h4>
<p>
    The <strong>+</strong> of the FURPS+ acronym allows you to specify constraints, such as design, implementation,
    interfaces, physical constraints, and business rules:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Design constraints</strong> limit the design and state requirements on the approach that should be taken in
        developing the system.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Implementation constraints</strong> put limits on coding or construction (required standards, languages,
        tools, or platform)
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Interface constraints</strong> are requirements to interact with external systems, describing protocols or
        the nature of the information that is passed across that interface.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Physical constraints</strong> affect the hardware or packaging housing the system (shape, size, and
        weight).
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Business rules</strong> are policies or decisions that govern how the business operates. They may constrain
        the steps described in the Use Case flow.

    Explanation
</h1>
<p>
    A use case describes the interactions between one of more <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../openup/guidances/concepts/actor_411726C.html" guid="_zGqO0MDpEduTGJ8i4u8TMw">Actor</a>s and the system in order to provide an observable result of value for the
    initiating actor.
</p>
<p>
    The functionality of a system is defined by different use cases, each of which represents a specific goal (to obtain
    the observable result of value) for a particular actor.
</p>
<p>
    In an automated teller machine shown in Figure 1, the Bank Customer can withdraw cash from an account, transfer
    funds between accounts, or deposit funds to an account. These correspond to specific goals that the actor has in using
    the system.

<p class="picturecenter" align="center">
     <img height="321" alt="automated teller machine and actors" src="openup/guidances/concepts/resources/im_uc.gif" width="456" />
</p>
<p>
    Each use case is associated with a goal of one of the actors. The collection of use cases constitutes all the possible
    ways of using the system. You should be able to determine the goal of a use case simply by observing its name.
</p>
<p>
    A use case describes the interactions between the actor(s) and the system in the form of a dialog between the actor(s)
    and the system, structured as follows:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        The actor &lt;&lt;does something&gt;&gt;
    </li>
    <li>
        The system &lt;&lt;does something in response&gt;&gt;
    </li>
    <li>
        The actor &lt;&lt;does something else&gt;&gt;
    </li>
    <li>
        The system…<br />
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    Each dialog of this form is called a “Flow of Events”.
</p>
<p>
    Because there are many flows of events possible for achieving the goal (for example, the flow may differ depending upon
    specific input from the actor), and there are situations in which the goal cannot be achieved (for example, a required
    network connection is currently unavailable), each use case will contain several flows, including one “Basic Flow of
    Events” and several “Alternative Flows”.
</p>
<p>
    The Basic Flow of Events specifies the interactions between the actor(s) and the system for the ideal case, where
    everything goes as planned, and the actor’s goal (the observable result of value) is met.  The basic flow
    represents the main capability provided by the system for this use case.
</p>
<p>
    As the name implies, Alternative Flows specify alternative interactions associated with the same goal.
</p>
<p>
    Closely related to use cases is the concept of a scenario.  A scenario is a <b>specific</b> flow of
    events, for a <b>specific</b> set of inputs to the system, states of the system, and states of the system’s
    environment.  Scenarios are closely related to test cases.
</p>
<h1>
    Properties of Use Cases
</h1>
<h2>
    <a id="Name" name="Name">Name</a>
</h2>
<p>
    Each use case should have a name that clearly describes the main goal of the use case. The name may have to be several
    words long to be understood. Typically the name is a verb phrase, for example: Withdraw Cash. <br/>
	<b>Note:</b> No two use cases can
    have the same name.
</p>
<h2>
    <a id="Brief Description" name="Brief Description">Brief Description</a>
</h2>
<p>
    The brief description of the use case should reflect its purpose. 
</p>

    Events -- Contents</a>
</h2>
<p>
    The <b>flow of events</b> should describe the interactions between the actor(s) and the system clearly enough for an
    outsider to easily understand. The flow of events should represent <i>what</i> the system does, not <i>how</i> the
    system is design to perform the required behavior.
</p>
<p>
    Follow these guidelines for the contents of the flow of events:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Describe how the use case starts and ends.
    </li>
    <li>
        Describe what data is exchanged between the actor and the use case.
    </li>
    <li>
        Do not describe the details of the user interface, unless it is necessary to understand the behavior of the system.
        Specifying user interface details too early will limit design options. 
    </li>
    <li>
        Describe the flow of events, not only the functionality. To enforce this, start every action with "When the actor
        ... ".  
    </li>
    <li>
        Avoid vague terminology.
    </li>
    <li>
        Detail the flow of events. Specify what happens when, for each action. Remember this text will be used to identify
        test cases.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    If you have used certain terms in other use cases, be sure to use the exact same terms in this use case, and
    that the meaning of the terms is consistent. To manage common terms, put them in a <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../openup/workproducts/glossary_5D300778.html" guid="_Wn7HcNcEEdqz_d2XWoVt6Q">Glossary</a>.
</p>
<h2>
    <a id="Flow of Events - Structure" name="Flow of Events - Structure">Flow of Events -- Structure</a>
</h2>
<p>
    The two main parts of the flow of events are <b>basic flow of events</b> and <a id="XE_flow_of_events__alternative_flow" name="XE_flow_of_events__alternative_flow"></a><b>alternative flows of
    events</b>. The basic flow of events should cover what "normally" happens when the use case is performed. The
    alternative flows of events cover behavior of optional or exceptional character in relation to the normal behavior, and
    also variations of the normal behavior. You can think of the alternative flows of events as detours from the basic flow
    of events, some of which will return to the basic flow of events and some of which will end the execution of the use
    case.
</p>
<p>
    The straight arrow in Figure 2 represents the basic flow of events, and the curves represent alternative paths in
    relation to the normal. Some alternative paths return to the basic flow of events, whereas others end the use
    case.

<p align="center">
    <img height="212" alt="Arrows representing flow of events" src="openup/guidances/concepts/resources/ucstrct.gif" width="231" />
</p>

<p>
    To clarify where an alternative flow of events fits in the structure, you need to describe the following for each
    detour to the basic flow of events:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Where the alternative flow can be inserted in the basic flow of events
    </li>
    <li>
        The condition that needs to be fulfilled for the alternative behavior to start
    </li>
    <li>
        How and where the basic flow of events is resumed, or how the use case ends
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    It might be tempting, if the alternative flow of events is very simple, to just describe it in the basic flow of events
    section (using some informal "if-then-else" construct). This should be avoided. Too many alternatives will make the
    normal behavior difficult to see. Also, including alternative paths in the basic flow of events section will make the
    text more pseudo-code like and harder to read.
</p>
<p>
    Both the basic and alternative flows may be further structured into subflows. In doing this, your main goal should be
    readability of the text. A guideline is that a subflow should be a segment of behavior within the use case that has a
    clear purpose, and is "atomic" in the sense that you do either all or none of the actions described.

    Requirements</a>
</h2>
<p>
    In the Special Requirements of a use case, you describe all the requirements on the use case that are not covered by
    the flow of events. These are typically non-functional requirements that will influence the design model. See also the
    discussion on non-functional requirements in <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../../openup/guidances/concepts/requirements_8006414F.html" guid="_0Wh-sMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">Concept: Requirements</a>.

</h2>
<p>
    A precondition is the state of the system and its surroundings that is required before the use case can be
    started. Post-Conditions are the states the system can be in after the use case has ended. It can
    be helpful to use the concepts of precondition and post-condition to clarify how the flow of events starts
    and ends. However, only use them if the audience for the description of the use case agrees that it is helpful.

<h1>
    Level of detail necessary in use cases
</h1>
<p>
    There will often be use cases in your model that are so simple that they do not need a detailed structured description
    of the use case (that is, a step-by-step outline is quite enough). The criteria for making this decision is that you don''t see
    disagreement among different readers on what the use case means, and that designers and testers are comfortable with
    the level of detail provided by the step-by-step format. Examples are use cases that describe simple data entry or retrieval
    in your system.
</p>
<p>
    For more information on possible formats and the level of detail captured for each use case see <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../../openup/guidances/guidelines/use_case_formats_FF4AE425.html" guid="_qq0GMAXkEduj_7BEUj1JfQ">Guideline: Use Case Formats</a>.

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Knowledge of testing approaches and techniques&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Diagnostic and problem-solving skills&#xD;

        Knowledge of networking and system architecture (desirable)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Where automated testing is required, consider requiring these additional qualifications:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Training in the appropriate use of test automation tools&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Experience using test automation tools&#xD;

          <MainDescription><![CDATA[<p>
    A test case specifies the conditions which need to be validated to enable an assessment of some particular aspects of
    the system under test. A test case is more formal than a test idea and usually takes the form of a specification. In
    less formal environments, test cases can be created by identifying a unique ID, name, associated test data, and
    expected results. For an example of this type of test case, see <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../openup/guidances/templates/test_case_A18913A5.html" guid="_0dT8IMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">Template: Test Case</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Test cases may be derived from many sources but will usually include a subset of both the requirements (such as use
    cases, performance characteristics, reliability concerns) and other types of quality attributes. For more information
    on types of tests and their relationship to quality test attributes, see <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../openup/guidances/concepts/types_of_test_CAE80710.html" guid="_0aJ6cMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">Concept: Types of Test</a>.

    This role leads or coordinates the technical design of the system and has overall responsibility for facilitating the

    architecturally significant aspects of the system as views that describe requirements, design, implementation, and
    deployment.
</p>
<p>
    This role is also responsible for providing the rationale for these decisions, balancing the concerns of the various

    This person in this role should be engaged in the project from start to finish.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For smaller projects, a single person may act as both Architect and &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../openup/roles/project_manager_E657F936.html&quot; guid=&quot;_0a0o0MlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw&quot;>Project Manager&lt;/a>. However, it is better to have these roles performed by different people to ensure that the pressures one&#xD;
    role doesn''t cause neglect of the other role.&amp;nbsp;The Architect and Project Manager&amp;nbsp;must work together closely.&#xD;
&lt;/p></AssignmentApproaches>
          <Skills>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Architects must be well-rounded people with maturity, vision, and a depth of experience that allows for grasping issues&#xD;
    quickly and making educated, critical judgments in the absence of complete information. Specifically, the person must&#xD;
    possess this combination of qualifications:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Experience&lt;/b> &lt;strong>in both problem and software engineering domains&lt;/strong>, with evidence of a thorough&#xD;
        understanding of the requirements to solve the problem and active participation in software development. If there&#xD;
        is a team, this experience can be represented by different team members, but at least one person must be able to&#xD;
        provide the overall vision for the project.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Leadership ability&lt;/b> to motivate and maintain momentum for the technical effort across the various teams and&#xD;
        to make critical decisions under pressure, plus make those decisions stick. To be effective, this role must have&#xD;
        the authority to make technical decisions.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Excellent communication&lt;/b> &lt;strong>skills&lt;/strong> to earn trust, persuade, motivate, and mentor. This role&#xD;
        cannot lead by decree, but only by the consent of the rest of the project team. To be effective, this&amp;nbsp;person&#xD;
        must earn the respect of the team members, the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../openup/roles/project_manager_E657F936.html&quot; guid=&quot;_0a0o0MlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw&quot;>Project Manager&lt;/a>, the customer, and the user community, as well as the management&#xD;
        team.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Goal-oriented and proactive&lt;/b> &lt;strong>orientation&lt;/strong> with a relentless focus on results.&amp;nbsp;This&#xD;
        person is the technical driving force behind the project, not a visionary or dreamer. The career of a successful&#xD;
        architect is a long series of sub-optimal decisions made in uncertainty and under pressure. Only those who can&#xD;
        focus on doing what needs to be done will be successful.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    From an expertise standpoint, this role also needs to show both design and implementation abilities. However, from the&#xD;
    design perspective, the effective architect typically exhibits these traits:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Tends to be a generalist, rather than a specialist, who knows many technologies at a high level rather than a few&#xD;
        technologies at the detail level&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Makes the broader technical decisions, thereby demonstrating broad knowledge and experience, as well as&#xD;
        communication and leadership skills&#xD;

          <MainDescription><![CDATA[<h1>
    What is an iteration
</h1>
<p>
    An iteration is a set period of time within a project in which you produce a stable, executable version of the product,
    together with any other supporting documentation, install scripts, or similar artifacts necessary to use this release. The
    executable is demonstrable, allowing the team to demonstrate true progress to stakeholders, and get feedback on how they
    are doing so that they can improve their understanding of what needs to be done and how to do it. 
</p>
<p>	
	Each iteration
    builds upon the results of the previous iteration, and will produce a product increment one step closer to the final
    product. Iterations are timeboxed, meaning that the schedule for an iteration should be regarded as fixed, and the scope of
    the iteration''s content actively managed to meet that schedule.
</p>
<p>
    At each iteration, artifacts are updated. It is said that this is a bit like "growing" software. Instead of developing
    artifacts one after another, in a pipeline fashion, they are evolving across the cycle, although at different rates.
</p>
<p>
    Iterative development is very disciplined: the iteration length is fixed, the objectives of iterations are carefully
    planned, the evaluation criteria are established when each iteration is planned, and the tasks and responsibilities of
    participants are well-defined. Additionally, objective measures of progress are captured. Some reworking takes place
    from one iteration to the next, but this too is done in a structured fashion.
</p>
<p>
    Each iteration should address the most critical risks, and implement the highest-priority Work Items. This ensures that
    each iteration adds maximum stakeholder value, and reduces uncertainty. Iterative development is typically combined
    with frequent or continuous integration: as unit-tested components become available, they are integrated, then a build
    is produced and subjected to integration testing. In this way, the capability of the integrated software grows as the
    iteration proceeds, towards the goals set when the iteration was planned. 
</p>
<p>	
	Regular builds, such as daily or more
    frequent builds, let you break down the integration and test issues and spread them across the development cycle. These
    issues have often been the downfall of large projects, because all of the problems were discovered at once during the single
    massive integration step, which occurred very late in the cycle, and where a single problem can halt the whole team.
</p>
<h1>
    What Problem Do Iterations Address?
</h1>
<p>
    Today’s software applications are too complex to allow you to sequentially define the requirements, come up with an
    architecture and design, perform an implementation, carry out testing, and get it all right. With waterfall development, you
    typically do not get meaningful feedback on what improvements can be made until it is so late in the project that it is
    too costly to make them. 
	</p>
<p>
	By contrast, dividing the project into a series of time-boxed iterations allows you to deliver
    capabilities that can be assessed by stakeholders at the end of each iteration. This approach provides rapid and timely
    feedback loops, enabling issues to be addressed and improvements made at a lower cost, while budget and time still allow,
    and before the project has gone so far ahead that major rework is required.
</p>
<h1>
    Iteration Length
</h1>
<p>
    Iterations are typically 4 weeks long, although some teams will work with iterations as short as a week or as long as
    six weeks. For factors driving iteration length, see the following table. <br/>

<h1>
    Why Iterate?
</h1>
<p>
    The iterative approach has proven itself superior to the waterfall approach for a number of reasons. See <a class="elementlinkwithusertext" href="./../../../openup/guidances/supportingmaterials/references_6CCF393.html#KRO05" guid="_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg">[KRO05]</a> for more details:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        You are more likely to build an application that addresses user needs, involve the customer in the development
        project, and implement and validate the capabilities deemed most essential in each iteration.
    </li>
    <li>
        Integration is not one “big bang” at the end of a project. Each iteration evolves executable code that is
        continuously integrated to enable rapid feedback and minimize later revision.
    </li>
    <li>
        Risks are usually discovered or addressed during early iterations. Implement the most essential capabilities
        partially, and demonstrate them to key stakeholders to make sure that you are on the right track.
    </li>
    <li>
        Your ability to work effectively is fine-tuned. During early iterations, team members are walking through all
        lifecycle activities, which ensures that they have the tools, skills, organizational structure, and so on to work
        effectively.
    </li>
    <li>
        Management has a way of making tactical changes to the product. Iterative development allows you to evolve partial
        implementations of the end product quickly, and use these for quick release of a reduced-scope product to counter a
        competitor''s move.
    </li>
    <li>
        Reuse is facilitated. Discussions and reviews of the design in early iterations allow team members to spot
        potential opportunities for reuse, and then develop a mature common code for these opportunities in subsequent
        iterations.
    </li>
    <li>
        Defects can be found and corrected over several iterations. Flaws are detected in early iterations, rather than
        during a massive testing phase at the end. 
    </li>
    <li>
        Project personnel are better used. An iterative process encourages widening the scope of expertise of the team
        members, allowing them to play many roles, and thus enabling a project manager to make better use of the available
        staff and simultaneously remove problematic handoffs.
    </li>
    <li>
        Team members learn along the way. The project members have several opportunities within a development cycle to
        learn from their mistakes and improve their skills from one iteration to another.
    </li>
    <li>
        The development process itself is improved and refined along the way. The end of iteration assessment includes a
        retrospective where the team identifies what can be improved in the next iteration in both the organization and the
        process.

    What is a Risk?
</h1>
<p>A risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, will have a negative or positive effect on one or more
project objectives [<a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../openup/guidances/supportingmaterials/references_6CCF393.html#PMI04" guid="_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg">PMI04</a>]. Project risks may be seen as threats or opportunities. The latter means
that taking a calculated risk may bring, for example, competitive advantage for a product or organization. 
If there are benefits associated with an opportunity, then you can take certain degrees of risk for a project to
be successful [<a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../openup/guidances/supportingmaterials/references_6CCF393.html#SEI99" guid="_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg">SEI99</a>].</p> 
<p>
    In everyday life a risk is an exposure to loss or injury: A factor, thing, element, or course involving uncertain
    danger. Similarly, in software development a risk is something that can compromise the success of a project.
    Examples of potential sources of risk in software development are listed below (see [<a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../openup/guidances/supportingmaterials/references_6CCF393.html#SEI99" guid="_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg">SEI99</a>] for more details):

        <b>Risk Category</b>: Risk identification is usually more easily done when there is a "mental framework"
        in place to ensure that potential areas of risk are not overlooked. One way of doing this is to divide risks into
        categories (such as technical, project management, organizational, and external), to ensure that all aspects of the
        project which are prone to risk are covered.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Risk Type:</b> Used to classify the risk as:
    </li>
    <li style="LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none">
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Direct risk</b>: A risk that the project has a large degree of control over
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Indirect risk</b>: A risk with little or no project control
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Risk Probability:</b> How likely the risk event will happen. This is usually represented as a scale of
        values (for example: High, Medium, Low). Probability is one of the most difficult quantities to judge accurately.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Risk Impact</b> (level): If this risk becomes a problem, what will the impact on
        the project be? This is not the actual <b>description</b> of the impact, but the <b>level</b> of impact. As the risk
        probability, it is usually represented as a scale. This attribute is also sometimes called the
        <b>severity</b> of the risk.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Risk Magnitude</b>: To be able to rank and define which risks need to be mitigate first, the
        <b>Risk Probability </b> and <b>Risk Impact</b> attributes are often combined in a
        single <b>Risk</b> <b>Magnitude</b> indicator represented as a scale similar to the
        combined attributes.
    </li>
</ul>
<h1>
    Risk Response Strategies
</h1>
<p>
    The risk response should be in line with the significance of the risk. The strategies for handling risk cover two
    main types: negative risks and positive risks (or opportunities). Common response strategies for negative risks or
    threats include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Avoid</b>: Reorganize the project so that it cannot be affected by that risk (for example, removing work)
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Mitigate</b>: Define actions to reduce the probability or the impact of the risk, removing it from the
        top of the list
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Transfer</b>: Reorganize the project so that someone or something else bears the risk. It simply
        gives another party responsibility for its management. It doesn''t eliminate the risk.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Common response strategies for positive risks or opportunities include:
</p>
<ul class="noindent">
    <li>
        <b>Exploit</b>: Add work or reorganize the project to make sure that the opportunity occurs (it
        is the reverse of avoid)
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Enhance</b>: Define actions to increase the probability or the positive impact of the risk
        (this is the reverse of mitigate)
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Share</b>: Allocate
        the ownership of the opportunity to a third party who is best able to capture the opportunity for the
        benefit of the project.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Another response strategy for both threats or opportunities is to <b>Accept</b>: Decide to live with the
    risk, and define a contingency plan.
</p>
<p>
    Some scenarios for software development may help to make these concepts more clear:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        You need to use a new framework. A risk avoidance strategy could be to drop this new framework and use another
        one that is already understood by the team.
    </li>
    <li>
        The application you are developing needs to communicate with a legacy system. A risk transfer strategy would
        be to have the legacy support team be responsible for providing the APIs to access the legacy system.
    </li>
    <li>
        You need to use new middleware. A risk mitigation strategy could be to build a prototype using this new middleware
        to validate that it will provide the features you need for your application.
    </li>
    <li>
        Your integrator is the only one who knows how to integrate the different components of your application. A
        contingency plan could be to identify a resource on another project that you could bring on if your integrator is
        sick, leaves the company, and so on.
    </li>
</ul>]]></MainDescription>

          <MainDescription><![CDATA[<p>
    The OpenUP family of processes aims at addressing a broad variety of project types while sharing a set of common
    characteristics. These are the key principles of:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../openup/guidances/concepts/core_principle_collaborate.html"
        guid="_KkTIsMp7EdqC_NfSivunjA">Collaborate to align interests and share understanding</a>

        guid="_ssG6MMvpEdqukPpotm3DYg">Balance competing priorities to maximize stakeholder value</a>.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Processes in the OpenUP family are written as extensions to the core OpenUP process, which embraces a pragmatic, agile
    philosophy focusing on the collaborative nature of software development. This core OpenUP process is a tools-agnostic,
    low-ceremony process that can be extended to address a broad variety of project types.
</p>
<p>
    By adding process plug-ins, extensions to OpenUP can be&nbsp;created that address a variety of development concerns,
    such as SOA, geographical distribution, model-driven architecture and embedded systems. Tool and technology specific
    guidance can be added, such as guidance on J2EE, and a variety of development tools. Some of these extensions can be
    quite modest, adding&nbsp;for example&nbsp;just tool specific guidance to existing tasks, while others could be quite
    comprehensive, creating processes that provide a radically expanded scope with new or altered artifacts, new or altered
    tasks, and new or altered roles.
</p>
<p>
    As stated above, to qualify as members of the OpenUP family, extending processes&nbsp;must comply with the key
    principles of OpenUP and be written as extensions to the OpenUP core process.
</p>
<p>
    Extensions to OpenUP can be:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        used internally by an organization
    </li>
    <li>
        open source as a part of the EPF project,
    </li>
    <li>
        made freely available outside the open source licenses of Eclipse (EPL)

          <MainDescription><![CDATA[<h3>
    Introduction
</h3>
<p>
    A good way to understand OpenUP is to think of it as targeted to teams that have the following objectives:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Apply the minimally necessary process that brings value.
    </li>
    <li>
        Avoid being overloaded with unproductive formal work products.
    </li>
    <li>
        Use a process that can be tailored and extended for additional needs that may arise during the software development
        lifecycle.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    In order to be applied to as many project environments as possible, OpenUP is a process that has the following
    characteristics:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Minimal - only fundamental content is included
    </li>
    <li>
        Complete - it can be manifested as an entire process to build a system
    </li>
    <li>
        Extensible - it can be used as a foundation on which process content can be added or tailored as needed
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    Minimal
</h4>
<p>
    OpenUP is considered an agile, lightweight process that promotes software development best practices such as:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        iterative development
    </li>
    <li>
        team collaboration
    </li>
    <li>
        continuous integration and tests
    </li>
    <li>
        frequent deliveries of working software
    </li>
    <li>
        adaptation to changes, and so on.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Other factors also count when determining the size of process material, such as the number of method elements like
    roles, tasks, artifacts and guidance.
</p>
<p>
    OpenUP provides descriptions of responsibilities, skills and competencies of the fundamental roles in a team. See the
    list of <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../openup/rolesets/openup_roles.html"
    guid="_TZIJ0O8NEdmKSqa_gSYthg">roles</a> for more details.
</p>
<p>
    OpenUP provides the essential artifacts needed to capture and communicate decisions. Ultimately, the process is not
    governed by artifact creation. For example, thinking about design is more important than documenting the design;
    assessing and planning an iteration is about promoting team collaboration instead of creating plans that are written in
    stone. In addition, for each artifact, OpenUP suggests informal representations or provides informal templates as
    starting points for teams that do not need to create their own. The team decides what the most appropriate form to be
    applied is. See the list of <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../openup/domains/openup_wp.html"
    guid="_s4Z9AMWXEdqWePvIjHInwg">work products</a> organized by domains.
</p>
<p>
    Tasks in OpenUP are clear and focused on results. Text is usually short and objective, describing how individuals
    should collaborate to achieve objectives. Steps are short descriptions of what to achieve, and point to external
    guidance on how to do it. See the list of <a class="elementLinkWithUserText"
    href="./../../../openup/disciplinegroupings/openup_disciplines.html" guid="__BZycP1UEdmek8CQTQgrOQ">tasks</a> organized
    by disciplines.
</p>
<p>
    OpenUP recommends the least amount of process guidance a team should use in order to be successful. Teams may have
    different names or responsibilities for roles, may perform tasks in or have different representations for artifacts,
    but they still want to follow the principles and practices described in OpenUP to increase the chances of project
    success.
</p>
<h4>
    Complete
</h4>
<p>
    OpenUP is considered a complete process because it covers the essential <a class="elementLinkWithUserText"
    href="./../../../openup/disciplinegroupings/openup_disciplines.html" guid="__BZycP1UEdmek8CQTQgrOQ">disciplines</a> in
    a software development lifecycle by guiding the team in the following high level activities:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Customer needs and requirements are elicited and captured, with continuous customer involvement.
    </li>
    <li>
        A robust architecture for the system is evolved, addressing technical risks and promoting team organization.
    </li>
    <li>
        For each requirement, a technical solution is designed, implemented and tested, which conforms to the architectural
        decisions.
    </li>
    <li>
        The system is evaluated by tests that validate customer requirements.
    </li>
    <li>
        Defects and enhancements feed back into development.
    </li>
    <li>
        Work is prioritized, iterations are planned and assessed, and team members take on work to be done.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    However, OpenUP assumes that the project team is not responsible for certain activities and decisions that are assigned
    to other areas of the organization, such as:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Creation of the business case is dealt with by management who decides whether or not the project is worth investing
        in, what is the return on investment, and so on.
    </li>
    <li>
        Environment setup - some organizational issues may not be in the scope of the team, such as: installation,
        configuration and licensing of development tools and configuration management tools; development process
        customization and publishing, etc.
    </li>
    <li>
        Deployment and operation - addressed at an organizational rather than a team level.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Other areas of concern are also not present in OpenUP, because small teams do not need to deal with the formality or
    overhead of these areas. They include, but are not limited to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Advanced configuration management
    </li>
    <li>
        Advanced requirements management
    </li>
    <li>
        Program and portfolio management
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    Extensible
</h4>
<p>
    OpenUP can be adopted by projects as it is, out-of-the-box, because it''s minimal and complete.
</p>
<p>
    However, different projects may have different needs. Organizations may be interested in customizing some aspects of
    OpenUP to adapt it to their projects. These are some examples of possible customization:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Add new or rename existing roles
    </li>
    <li>
        Add steps to existing tasks
    </li>
    <li>
        Create new guidelines on a given technique
    </li>
    <li>
        Remove a given content area
    </li>
    <li>
        Modify existing or add new templates to artifacts
    </li>
    <li>
        Modify or create a new process lifecycle
    </li>
    <li>
        Add or remove process content
    </li>
    <li>
        Add guidance on how to achieve compliance
    </li>
    <li>
        Add guidance specific to a technology being used
    </li>
    <li>
        Replace or augment&nbsp;one of the layers with new&nbsp;content (e.g. by changing&nbsp;or adding material to how
        management is performed)
    </li>
    <li>
        Etc.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    OpenUP can be customized and extended by using the EPF Composer tool, which allows you to author, configure and publish
    methods. With EPF Composer, you can add, remove and change elements according to your team needs, then publish the
    content to serve as guidance for your team.

          <MainDescription><![CDATA[<h3>
    Explanation
</h3>
<p>
    To fully understand the system''s purpose, you must know who the system is for, that is: Who will use the system? The
    answer to this question is: the Actors.
</p>
<p>
    An Actor is a role that a person or external system plays&nbsp;when interacting with the system.&nbsp; Instances of an
    Actor can be an individual or an external system, however each Actor&nbsp;provides a
    unique&nbsp;and&nbsp;important&nbsp;perspective on the system that is shared by every instance of the Actor.
</p>
<p>
    This difference between an actor and an instance of an actor is illustrated below.&nbsp;&nbsp;Figure 1 shows a case in
    which Ivar and Mark are operators of a recycling machine. When they are using the machine in this capacity, each is
    represented by an instance of the actor called Operator that expects certain functionality of the system (Print Daily
    Reports in this example).
</p>
<p>
    <img height="322" alt="" src="openup/guidances/concepts/resources/md_acto2.gif" width="396" />&nbsp;
</p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    <p>
        <strong>Figure 1:&nbsp;Example Actor with multiple instances</strong>&nbsp;
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
    Conversely, the same user can act as several actors (that is, the same person can take on different roles). In Figure
    2, Charlie uses the Depot-Handling System primarily as Depot Manager, but sometimes he also uses the Depot-Handling
    System as an ordinary Depot Staff member. Each of these actors expects different functionality of the system.
</p>

</p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    <p>
        <strong>Figure 2: Example of user playing different roles</strong><br />
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
    Actors help you to identify external interfaces and to determine the scope the system (what is in the system, vs. what
    is outside the system boundary).&nbsp; Each&nbsp;Actor has associated use cases which describe what that
    particular&nbsp;actor expects of the system.&nbsp; It will be very difficult, if not impossible,&nbsp;to assess the
    completeness of the set of Use Cases without the context provided by the associated Actors. Furthermore, missing an
    actor may result in&nbsp;missing important stakeholder perspectives, resulting&nbsp;in a solution that does not meet
    all&nbsp;stakeholder needs.
</p>
<p>
    Hence, identifying the Actors for the system&nbsp;should be done early in the lifecycle.&nbsp;&nbsp;Actors are
    captured, including their names, brief descriptions, and relationships to use cases,&nbsp;in the <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../../openup/workproducts/uc_model_85965D1B.html" guid="_W2SgEDR5EdutE_HNDTJk5Q">Artifact: Use-Case Model</a>.
</p>
<h3>
    Properties of Actors
</h3>
<h4>
    Name
</h4>
<p>
    Each actor should have a name that clearly describes the role played by the user.
</p>
<h4>
    Brief Description
</h4>
<p>
    Each actor should have a brief description that clearly describes:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        What or who the actor represents.
    </li>
    <li>
        Why the actor is needed.
    </li>
    <li>
        What interests the actor has in the system
    </li>
    <li>
        Major characteristics of the actor.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The major characteristics of the actor&nbsp;are important as they may influence how the system is developed, for
    example characteristics of the user interface such as accessibility or globalization.&nbsp; Examples of important
    characteristics include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The actors level of domain knowledge
    </li>
    <li>
        The actors level of computer experience
    </li>
    <li>
        The actors abilities and disabilities
    </li>
    <li>
        The actors native language

          <MainDescription><![CDATA[<h1> Customization resources</h1>
<p> There are a number of use scenarios for OpenUP. The simplest&nbsp;is to use 
  the&nbsp;content available from the EPF project (either the available published 
  Web site or the one that you publish from the available library). You can find 
  those resources at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/epf">www.eclipse.org/epf</a>. 
</p>
<p> However, you may be&nbsp;looking for&nbsp;adding, removing, suppressing, or 
  modifying method and process elements to make OpenUP&nbsp;more&nbsp;suitable&nbsp;to 
  your teams'' needs, while keeping it consistent and understandable. </p>
<p> The following sections introduce a few fundamental concepts about&nbsp;method 
  content and process, as well as&nbsp;descriptions of typical customization scenarios 
  and&nbsp;links to additional information on how to customize methods. </p>
<h2> Method organization </h2>
<p> You can use EPF Composer to write, configure, and publish method and process 
  content. EPF Composer organizes the content in a <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../base_concepts/guidances/termdefinitions/method_library_6E08F9E5.html" guid="_1xELEMaFEduMlb2cQZNTYw">method 
  library</a>. Each method library contains one or more <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../base_concepts/guidances/termdefinitions/method_plugin_190B9F5E.html" guid="_D4TLgMaGEduMlb2cQZNTYw">method 
  plug-ins</a>. Every plug-in consists of two major packages:&nbsp;<a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../base_concepts/guidances/termdefinitions/content_package_F5C69063.html" guid="_SAWgwMaFEduMlb2cQZNTYw">content 
  packages</a> and <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../base_concepts/guidances/termdefinitions/process_package_368B7463.html" guid="_MN1doMaHEduMlb2cQZNTYw">process 
  packages</a>. Content packages contain <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../base_concepts/guidances/termdefinitions/content_element_DA3AD029.html" guid="_N8x34B_LEdq6CKKKq4D7YA">content 
  elements</a>, such as <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../base_concepts/guidances/termdefinitions/role_37A0C602.html" guid="_yUefQNnmEdmO6L4XMImrsA">roles</a>, 
  <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../base_concepts/guidances/termdefinitions/task_6C1FF051.html" guid="_x459ktnmEdmO6L4XMImrsA">tasks</a>, 
  <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../base_concepts/guidances/termdefinitions/work_product_826E4C22.html" guid="_H4JXwB_SEdq6CKKKq4D7YA">work 
  products</a>, and <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../base_concepts/guidances/termdefinitions/guidance_549AC394.html" guid="_83ttAB_NEdq6CKKKq4D7YA">guidance</a>. 
  Process packages contain <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../base_concepts/guidances/termdefinitions/capability_pattern_F5DDC5F.html" guid="_2RUJACO4EdqaNq6Ptg8uyA">capability 
  patterns</a> and <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../base_concepts/guidances/termdefinitions/delivery_process_BCDF50B7.html" guid="_ZufeMCO3EdqaNq6Ptg8uyA">delivery 
  processes</a>. </p>
<p> Method content and processes are organized in the EPF method library according 
  to how they build logical units for useful <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../base_concepts/guidances/termdefinitions/method_configuration_C2B8FA8A.html" guid="__V7pAMaEEduMlb2cQZNTYw">method 
  configurations</a>. For example, all content belonging to one specific discipline, 
  such as requirements or development, can be found in one content package. Each 
  of these packages might be further divided into sub-packages for specific practices 
  in these disciplines. For example,&nbsp;under Development,&nbsp;you may want 
  to&nbsp;have a package that&nbsp;factors all of the specific information about 
  visual modeling. Thus, you can add or remove&nbsp;visual modeling&nbsp;specifics 
  from&nbsp;Development with just one simple mouse-click by selecting or deselecting 
  the right package. </p>
<p> For more information on method organization, see <b>EPF Composer Overview</b>, 
  <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/epf/general/EPFComposerOverviewPart1.pdf" target="_blank">Part 
  1</a> and <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/epf/general/EPFComposerOverviewPart2.pdf" target="_blank">Part 
  2</a>. </p>
<h2> Customization scenarios </h2>
<p> The following sections describe&nbsp;several possible customization scenarios. 
  For step-by-step instructions, see the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/epf/general/EPFComposer_OpenUP.zip" target="_blank">Customization 
  Scenarios</a> tutorial. </p>
<h3> Use existing plug-ins and packages to build your own process </h3>
<p> This is the most straight-forward customization scenario. Based on the content 
  provided by OpenUP, you can use EPF Composer to pick and choose the packages 
  with the content that you want to have published and made available to your 
  team. Removing a method package removes all references to the content of that 
  package from the published process. For example, you can simplify a process 
  to have it contain a minimal subset of its content by removing packages that 
  contain elements of work that you do not want to perform. You do this by creating 
  a new method configuration (or copying an existing one) into your method library. 
  You can select packages as appropriate without affecting the configuration provided. 
</p>
<h3> Add&nbsp;method content&nbsp;that your team needs</h3>
<p> Some teams may need to perform a different task that is not contemplated by 
  the out-of-the-box content. Maybe they need to perform an extra step in an existing 
  task, or they may need to add a new guideline for a given technique that they 
  are following. Eventually, they need a new template for a document (or may need 
  to add or remove sections in an existing template). </p>
<p> In such situations, the recommended approach is to create a separate plug-in 
  in your library.&nbsp;It is not a good practice&nbsp;to make changes in the 
  provided OpenUP plug-in (or any plug-in for which you do not have control), 
  because new versions of these plug-ins, when deployed, can override the changes 
  that you have made. </p>
<p> EPF Composer provides a series of mechanisms that allow you to indirectly 
  modify the content in an existing plug-in by using content variability. In your 
  plug-in, you can define an element that contributes, extends, or replaces an 
  element in the existing plug-in. For example, in your plug-in, you can define 
  a task that contributes a new step to an existing task in OpenUP. You can also 
  define a new artifact that replaces one in OpenUP, and this new artifact can 
  have a different name, structure, and associated template, for example. </p>
<p> When you create a new plug-in, it should depend on existing plug-ins to where 
  content will be contributed, extended or replaced. After you have created your 
  plug-in, you add&nbsp;it to a new configuration from which you can finally select 
  the packages with content that you want published. During publication, EPF Composer 
  will resolve the content variability that you defined by adding the new content 
  into the existing content where appropriate, replacing existing content with 
  the content you defined, and so on. </p>
<h3> Define a different development lifecycle </h3>
<p> Both method content and process are created independently from&nbsp;each other. 
  For example, you create tasks in the method content (and define their&nbsp;inputs, 
  outputs, and responsible roles), but you do not necessarily define the lifecycle 
  of your process, meaning the sequence in which the various tasks will be performed. 
  On the process side, you then define the lifecycle (such as phases, iterations, 
  activities, and tasks), as well as the precedence among these elements. </p>
<p> Some teams may find the method content appropriate without any further customization, 
  but they may want to work by following a different software development lifecycle. 
  Some teams may like the four development phases and iterations from OpenUP, 
  but some may want to develop iteratively, without being tied to the phase structure. 
</p>
<p> You can add, remove and replace elements in the work breakdown structure of 
  an existing process by applying variability. This is called<b> process contribution</b>, 
  which means that differential changes can be applied to an existing process. 
</p>
<p> As an alternative to tailoring an existing process, you can write a completely 
  new process that reuses activities from one or more existing processes. In cases 
  where you cannot find any reusable material at all, you can also create a completely 
  new process from scratch. In most cases, however, you will start developing 
  your own process by assembling reusable building blocks from method content, 
  as well as predefined process patterns&nbsp;called <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../base_concepts/guidances/termdefinitions/capability_pattern_F5DDC5F.html" guid="_2RUJACO4EdqaNq6Ptg8uyA">capability 
  patterns</a>. The resulting assembled process is called a&nbsp;<a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../base_concepts/guidances/termdefinitions/delivery_process_BCDF50B7.html" guid="_ZufeMCO3EdqaNq6Ptg8uyA">delivery 
  process</a>. </p>
<p> This newly created delivery process&nbsp;is part of a configuration that you 
  publish and make available to members of your team. </p>
<h3> Publish the process Web site </h3>
<p> Every customization scenario is finalized by publishing content in a Web site 
  format that can&nbsp;be accessed by practitioners in the project. EPF Composer 
  allows you to publish&nbsp;content based on a given configuration, which will 
  publish all of the content available from the&nbsp;method and process packages 
  selected in that configuration. Another option for publishing is to select only 
  the capability patterns or delivery process of interest. This will make available 
  only the content related to the process packages that you select.</p>
<p> For the published Web site look and feel, you can customize the views and 
  nodes in the directory (tree) browser by defining <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../base_concepts/guidances/termdefinitions/custom_category_554AC4D6.html" guid="_eqw94MaFEduMlb2cQZNTYw">custom 
  categories</a> that will be part of your configuration. </p>]]></MainDescription>

          <MainDescription><![CDATA[<h1>Opportunities in the OpenUP community </h1>
<p>OpenUP is developed by the Eclipse Process Framework (EPF) team. EPF is an 
  open source community that depends solely on the active participation of its 
  user community to produce process content and tools. There are a variety of 
  ways to participate in the development and deployment of OpenUP, depending on 
  your interest and skill level. </p>
<p> If all you want to do is ask a few questions to get started, sign up for the 
  EPF Newsgroup. If you want to participate in discussions and decisions about 
  the content and direction of OpenUP, sign up for the epf-dev mailing list. Use 
  Bugzilla to get your hands dirty by reporting bugs and enhancements, verifying 
  the correctness of method content, or submitting method content to address process 
  issues. Participate at the highest levels by joining OpenUP technical and committee 
  meetings. These meetings are where detailed process issues and product strategy 
  are discussed. </p>
<p>
    Everyone who downloads or uses OpenUP is encouraged to participate at some level. OpenUP is only as good as the quality
    of the participation of its contributors.
</p>
<h2> EPF newsgroup </h2>
<p> The EPF Newsgroup is the place to ask and answer questions about OpenUP, EPF 
  Composer, and other EPF processes. Most of the traffic involves how to use EPF 
  Composer and OpenUP. It’s monitored by the community, and you can access it 
  like you do any newsgroup. Everyone who uses OpenUP will benefit from the support 
  it offers and by receiving announcements about OpenUP. Sign up for the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/epf/community/community_index.php">newsgroup.</a> 
</p>
<h2> EPF-Dev mailing list </h2>
<p> The epf-dev mailing list is used by the OpenUP development community to communicate 
  and discuss development issues. Sign up for the <a href="https://dev.eclipse.org/mailman/listinfo/epf-dev.">mailing 
  list</a> to participate in technical discussions and receive meeting announcements.</p>
<h2> Bugs, enhancements, and process content </h2>
<p> Bugzilla is the tool used to track changes and tasks for OpenUP. Bugzilla 
  is the Work Items List for the OpenUP project and contains the requirements, 
  enhancements, bugs, to-do items, and so forth for the project. Anyone in the 
  community is invited to report bugs and enhancements, to provide content addressing 
  the bugs and enhancements, and to help validate that the content is correct. 
  You can provide content simply by adding an attachment to any Bugzilla entry. 
</p>
<p> Learn how to use <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/epf/process/change_request_faq.php">Bugzilla 
  change requests</a> for OpenUP. </p>
<p> Content can be submitted as text files or exported from EPF Composer as plug-ins 
  or XML. Edit the latest version of the libraries by downloading them from the 
  CVS in EPF Composer. Set up EPF Composer to download the OpenUP library by following 
  the instructions on the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/epf/composer_dev_guide/cvs_setup.php">EPF 
  Composer Development Guide</a>. Note that only committers can commit changes 
  to the CVS. Any changes made by contributors must be attached to a Bugzilla 
  entry. </p>
<h2> Meetings and committees</h2>
<p> There are numerous meetings every week to discuss OpenUP progress and define 
  solutions. The <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/eclipseprocessframework/cal" title="EPF Calendar">EPF 
  Calendar</a> is open to everyone and lists all upcoming meetings (teleconferences 
  and face-to-face). Participate in these meetings to dive deeply into OpenUP 
  issues by collaborating directly with other members of the community. Although 
  everyone is welcome to attend these meetings, it’s generally expected that participants 
  will, at some point, take responsibility for some OpenUP tasks. </p>
<p> The calendar and epf-dev newsgroup also announce the EPF Committer meetings. 
  Currently, these are held quarterly in both the North America and Europe. This 
  is the highest level of participation, where committers and contributors make 
  critical decisions about EPF projects, including OpenUP. Everyone from the OpenUP 
  community is welcome, and attendees are expected to participate in discussions 
  and take on responsibility for addressing aspects of the EPF. </p>]]></MainDescription>

          <MainDescription><![CDATA[<p>
    The project lifecycle provides <em>stakeholders</em> with oversight, transparency, and steering mechanisms to control
    project funding, scope, risk exposure, value provided, and other aspects of the process.
</p>
<p>
    Each iteration delivers a product increment, which provides an opportunity for stakeholders to understand what value
    has been delivered and how well the project is tracking. It also gives the development team the opportunity to make
    changes to the project to optimize the outcome.
</p>
<p>
    OpenUP organizes iterations into a set of phases. Each phase ends with a milestone aimed at providing oversight by
    raising and answering a set of questions that are typically critical to stakeholders:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../openup/guidances/concepts/inception_phase.html"
        guid="_0hmKgBOMEduCNqgZdt_OaA">Inception</a>. Do we agree on project scope and objectives, and whether or not the
        project should proceed?
    </li>
    <li>
        <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../openup/guidances/concepts/elaboration_phase.html"
        guid="_2plxwBOMEduCNqgZdt_OaA">Elaboration</a>. Do we agree on the executable architecture to be used for
        developing the application and do we find that the value delivered so far and the remaining risk is acceptable?
    </li>
    <li>
        <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../openup/guidances/concepts/construction_phase.html"
        guid="_48EKsBOMEduCNqgZdt_OaA">Construction</a>. Do we find that we have an application that is sufficiently close
        to being released that we should switch the primary focus of the team to tuning, polishing and ensuring successful
        deployment?
    </li>
    <li>
        <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../openup/guidances/concepts/transition_phase.html"
        guid="__ca5UBOMEduCNqgZdt_OaA">Transition</a>. Is the application ready to release?
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    If the answer is Yes to the above questions at the phase review, the project continues. If the answer is No, the phase
    is delayed (usually by adding an extra iteration) until a satisfactory answer is received, or the stakeholders may
    determine that the project should be cancelled.
</p>
<p>
    One of the objectives of the project lifecycle is to focus on two key stakeholder drivers: risk reduction and value
    creation. The OpenUP phases focus the team on risk reduction related to the questions to be answered at the end of the
    phase, while tracking value creation, see Figure below.

</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">
    <em>Risk reduction (red curve) and value creation (green curve) during the project lifecycle.</em>
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Risk is a manifestation of the likelihood of unexpected things happening to the project, and risk stands in the way of
    value creation. Risk is directly proportional to uncertainty in estimates, and stakeholders typically want to know
    sooner rather than later what value the project can deliver in the stipulated time. In many cases, you reduce risk when
    you create value by implementing and testing the most critical capabilities. However, there are situations where risk
    reduction and immediate value creation are at odds with each other, see <a class="elementLink"

          <MainDescription><![CDATA[<p>
    Iterations in OpenUP keep the team focused on delivering incremental customer value every few weeks by delivering a
    fully tested demo-able or shippable build (product increment). This creates a healthy focus on ensuring that whatever
    is worked on is of value to the stakeholders. Decision making must to happen faster since there is no time for endless
    debate. Iterative development focuses on producing working code reducing the risk of analysis-paralysis. Frequent
    demonstration of working code provides feedback mechanisms that allow course corrections to be taken as needed.
</p>
<p>
    Iteration planning, estimation, and progress tracking are centered on work items. The iteration plan is created by
    selecting the top-priority work items. Agile estimation techniques are used to understand how many work items can
    safely fit within the time-boxed iteration, and work items are filtered to ensure that the chosen work items will allow
    the team to deliver upon iteration objectives agreed to by stakeholders. Progress is demonstrated through continuous
    completion of many small work items (see <a class="elementLink"
    href="./../../../openup/guidances/concepts/micro_increments.html" guid="_S80VwCNbEdyCq8v2ZO4QcA">Micro-Increments</a>).
</p>
<p>
    Just as a project goes through a lifecycle, iterations go through a lifecycle with a different focus for the team
    depending on whether you are in the first versus the last week of the iteration, see Figure below and <a
    class="elementlinkwithusertext" href="./../../../openup/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.html#JAZZ"
    guid="_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg">[JAZZ]</a>. An iteration starts with an iteration planning meeting that is a few hours
    long. The initial one or two days are typically focused on further planning and architecture to, among other things,
    understand the dependencies and logical ordering of work items, and architectural impacts of the work to be done. Most
    of the time during an iteration is spent on executing the micro increments. Each micro increment should deliver tested
    code to a build, as well as validated artifacts. To give additional discipline, stable builds are produced at the end
    of each week. More attention is spent on these builds to make sure that the quality is not eroding and issues are dealt
    with early so the success of the iteration isn’t jeopardized. The last week or last few days of the iteration typically
    have a stronger emphasis on polishing and bug fixing than earlier weeks, even though new features are added as
    appropriate. The goal is to never let quality erode, thus ensuring&nbsp;that a high-quality useful product increment is
    produced at the end of the iteration. The iteration ends with an assessment (with stakeholders) of what was built, and
    a retrospective to understand how to improve the process for next iteration.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
    <em>An iteration goes through a lifecycle with a stronger focus on planning and architecture early-on and a stronger
    focus on bug-fixing and stabilization toward the end.</em>
</p>
<p>
    Team members work more effectively if they can influence what they do and how they do it, rather than operating in an
    environment where they are told what to do. Giving the team the ability and responsibility to organize their work and
    determine how to best meet their commitments motivates team members to do their best. This also helps them collaborate
    to ensure that the right skills are applied to the appropriate tasks. Self organization impacts many areas, including
    how planning and commitments are made (by a team, not by individuals), how work is assigned (you sign up versus get
    assigned), and how team members view their role in the project (team member first, job function second).
</p>
<p>
    <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../openup/guidances/guidelines/self_organize_work_assignments.html"
    guid="_rmBEkJjsEduad8I_c-ogIA">Self organization</a>&nbsp;requires a few things to work:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Transparency and commitments are crucial to aid in team communication and to bring out the best in the team
        members. Open communication about the team’s commitments related to the iteration lifecycle, and personal
        commitments made relative to micro increments ensure that execution problems are vetted and the right people are
        focused on solving them.
    </li>
    <li>
        Coaching is required to help teams self organize and to remove barriers for success. The assumption is that the
        project manager is the coach. This requires that the project manager avoid a command-and-control style of
        management in favor of a coaching style. This has been a key recommendation in management books for the last two
        decades, but some project managers may still not be able to make that transition.

          <MainDescription><![CDATA[<p>
    Personal contribution on an OpenUP project is organized in <strong>micro-increments</strong>. A micro-increment
    represents the outcome of a few hours to a few days of work for one, or typically a few people collaborating to reach
    the goals of the iteration. The concept of a micro-increment helps the individual team member to partition their work
    into small units that each delivers something of measurable value to the team. Micro-increments provide an extremely
    short feedback loop that drives adaptive decisions within each iteration.
</p>
<p>
    A micro-increment should be well defined, and you should be able to track daily progress of each micro-increment.
    Micro-increments are specified and tracked by a work item. Change sets represent the physical outcome in terms of the
    files are modified as a part of completing the work item. Let’s have a look at some sample micro-increments:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <em>Identify Stakeholders.</em> Defining the Vision is a task that can drag on for weeks, so to ensure that you
        make and track daily progress, divide the task into small and well-defined micro-increments. Describing and getting
        buy-in on what Stakeholders to put into a Vision document is a meaningful result, and may take a few hours, or at
        most a few days, and thus represents a suitable micro-increment.
    </li>
    <li>
        <em>Develop Solution Increment.</em> Defining, designing, implementing, and testing a use case or even a scenario
        can take weeks or longer. To ensure continuous progress, we seek to divide the work into smaller increments, each
        of which can be done in a couple of days. A more suitable micro-increment may be to only define, design, implement,
        and test a subflow of a use-case or step within a scenario.
    </li>
    <li>
        <em>Agree on Technical Approach for Persistency.</em> Agreeing on your technical solution may take quite some time,
        so we need to narrow the task to something that can be defined and agreed to in a short time. One way to partition
        the work is according to the issues you need to resolve, such as persistency or reporting. This micro-increment
        will probably involve defining requirements, surveying available assets, prototyping, and documentating the
        decisions.
    </li>
    <li>
        <em>Plan Iteration.</em> This micro-increment could include setting up a meeting for creating the iteration plan,
        doing some preparation for the meeting, such as reviewing candidate work items, coaching the team through the
        iteration planning meeting, and posting the iteration plan for easy access. The end result is something complete
        and measurable, a posted plan that has buy-in from the team.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Your application evolves in micro-increments through simultaneous execution of a number of work items. By openly
    sharing progress on your micro-increments through daily team meetings and team collaboration tools, you achieve the
    transparency and insight into each other’s work required for effective teamwork. At the same time, you demonstrate
    continuous progress by evolving your application one micro-increment at the time.
</p>
<p>
    OpenUP provides a set of activities. Each activity is captured as a set of tasks, steps within tasks, and guidance.
    Even thought micro-increments are not an explicit construct in the process, you will find descriptions of how to carry
    out a set of related micro-increments that are commonly found in projects within the activity. OpenUP does not provide
    a complete description of potential micro-increments, and each organization should consider adding their own ‘recipes’
    for commonly occurring micro-increments.
</p>
<p>
    OpenUP provides a powerful learning tool and makes it easier to find relevant guidance by outlining when you are most
    likely to carry out various tasks. This is done through a visualization of the delivery process which provides a
    time-based organization of the tasks within the context of a <a class="elementLink"
    href="./../../../openup/guidances/concepts/project_lifecycle_203F87.html" guid="_nSfVwCNYEdyCq8v2ZO4QcA">Project
    Lifecycle</a>. As an example, you are more likely to agree on a technical approach early in the project. This doesn’t
    mean you wouldn’t make technical decisions late in the project. A process is like a map, use it to understand the big
    picture and as a reference, but when reality and map don’t match, trust reality.

    OpenUP is most useful for four primary groups of users:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Software development practitioners (developers, project managers, analysts, and testers) working together as a
        project team
    </li>
    <li>
        Stakeholders
    </li>
    <li>
        Software process engineers
    </li>
    <li>
        Instructors
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Software development practitioners can find guidance on what is required of them in the roles defined by OpenUP. Each
    role describes a set of activities and artifacts for which the role is responsible. Guidance is also given on how those
    roles collaborate.
</p>
<p>
    Stakeholders will find guidance on what they may expect from the software development team, and how the software will
    be created. OpenUP also describes the stakeholders'' responsibilities, and states how they can best work with the
    development team to obtain software that meets their needs.
</p>
<p>
    Software process engineers can use EPF Composer to extend and modify OpenUP. Modification may be as simple as altering
    templates for work products, or as sophisticated as adding activities necessary for creating software in your specific
    environment (such as audits for safety-critical systems). In addition to modifying method content, process engineers
    can add, change, or remove process flows to add organization-specific capability patterns.
</p>
<p>
    OpenUP is appropriate for academic organizations also. As an open source process, it can serve as the basis for
    software engineering courses and, when combined with the EPF Composer, courses in software process engineering.<br />

    Attached are templates for describing the architecture in a small, co-located project. At a minimum, all projects
    should describe the goals and philosophy of the architecture, identify assumptions and dependencies, reference the
    architecturally significant requirements, describe the architectural mechanisms, and describe decisions and constraints
    with their justifications.
</p>
<p>
    Architects should consider when it''s appropriate to add more information to the Architecture Notebook. A small project
    shouldn''t spend lots of time documenting the architecture, but all critical elements of the system must be communicated
    to current and future team members. Consider including useful architectural views, references to architecturally
    significant areas of the design, key abstractions, critical system interface descriptions, and a description of the
    architectural framework or pattern.

          <MainDescription><![CDATA[<p> This template describes how the design can be organized to be understood from 
  multiple perspectives. It also provides suggestions for how patterns and descriptions 
  of small, reusable interactions can be used to minimize redundancy. </p>
<p> It is important not to think of design as &quot;a document." Design information 
  that is worth keeping for some duration must have a long-lived form. But that 
  form might be as a repository in a visual modeling tool, or as subdirectories 
  of whiteboard diagrams captured with a digital camera, or as an actual document 
  that provides structure for images taken from a myriad of sources. </p>
<p> This template describes the information that should be conveyed. Typically, 
  it works best to convey the information graphically (either with UML or another 
  unambiguous notation), or at least in words, at an abstract level. You can enhance 
  this with code examples, but best not to render the design solely at the code 
  level. </p>
<p>
    The structure of the design is suggested in this template.
</p>
<h1> Design structure </h1>
<p style="COLOR: #0000ff"> [Describe the design from the highest level. This 
  is commonly done with a diagram that shows a layered architecture.] </p>
<h1> Subsystems </h1>
<h2> [Sub-system1] </h2>
<p style="COLOR: #0000ff"> [Describe the design of a portion of the system (a 
  package or component, for instance). The design should capture both static and 
  dynamic perspectives. </p>
<p style="COLOR: #0000ff"> When capturing dynamic descriptions of behavior, look 
  for reusable chunks of behavior that you can reference to simplify the design 
  of the use-case realizations. </p>
<p style="COLOR: #0000ff"> You can break this section down into lower-level subsections 
  to describe lower-level, encapsulated subsystems.] </p>
<h1> Patterns </h1>
<h2> [Pattern1] </h2>
<h3> Overview </h3>
<p style="COLOR: #0000ff"> [Provide an overview of the pattern in words in some 
  consistent form. The overview of a pattern can include the intent, motivation, 
  and applicability.] </p>
<h3> Structure </h3>
<p style="COLOR: #0000ff"> [Describe the pattern from a static perspective. Include 
  all of the participants and how they relate to one another, and call out the&nbsp;relevant 
  data and behavior.] </p>
<h3> Behavior </h3>
<p style="COLOR: #0000ff"> [Describe the pattern from a dynamic perspective. Walk 
  the reader through how the participants collaborate to support various scenarios.] 
</p>
Example 
<p style="COLOR: #0000ff"> [Often, you can convey the nature of the pattern better 
  with an additional concrete example.] </p>
<h1> Use-case realizations </h1>
<h2> [Realization1] </h2>
<h3> View of participants </h3>
<p style="COLOR: #0000ff"> [Describe the participating design elements from a 
  static perspective, giving details such as behavior, relationships, and attributes 
  relevant to this use-case realization.] </p>
<h3> Basic scenario </h3>
<p style="COLOR: #0000ff"> [For the main flow, describe how instances of the design 
  elements collaborate to realize the use case. When using UML, this can be done 
  with collaboration diagrams (sequence or communication).] </p>
<h3> Additional scenarios </h3>
<p style="COLOR: #0000ff"> [For other scenarios that must be described to convey 
  an appropriate amount of information about how the use-case behavior will be 
  realized, describe how instances of the design elements collaborate to realize 
  the use case. When using UML, you can do this with collaboration diagrams (sequence 
  or communication).] </p>]]></MainDescription>

            <MainDescription><![CDATA[<h3>
    Background
</h3>
<p>
    Change requests typically have a lifecycle. They are raised,&nbsp;reviewed, accepted or rejected, implemented, verified
    and closed. These states define the status of the change request at a particular point in time and represent critical
    information for tracking progress. Other sets of states are possible.
</p>
<p>
    During review of a change request, the goal&nbsp;is to assess the&nbsp;technical, cost, and schedule impact
    of&nbsp;implementing the change.&nbsp; The technical impact&nbsp;assessment includes&nbsp;the determination of
    which&nbsp;work products&nbsp;are affected and an estimate of the level of effort required to change and verify all
    affected artifacts. This information becomes the basis of the cost and schedule impact assessments and, ultimately,
    whether the change request will be accepted or rejected.
</p>
<p>
    If accepted, the implementation and verification of the change request will be assigned to an iteration in the same
    manner as any other work item.
</p>
<p>
    The&nbsp;current process uses the <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../../openup/workproducts/work_items_list_39D03CC8.html" guid="_rGNWsCbSEdqh1LYUOGRh2A">Artifact: Work Items List</a> to capture, prioritize, and track the change requests
    using the attributes defined for that artifact.
</p>
<h3>
    Submitting Change Requests
</h3>
<p>
    When submitting a change request provide as much information as possible to enable a speedy review and
    disposition.&nbsp; As a minimum, all change requests should include the following information:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>ID</strong> - a unique identifier for the change request to simplify tracking.&nbsp; If you are using some
        form of change tracking tool the tool will assign a unique ID.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Brief Description</strong>&nbsp;- a name that summarizes the change request
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Detailed Description</strong> - A detailed description of the change request.&nbsp; For a defect, if you
        can provide information that will help reproduce the defect please do so.&nbsp; For an enhancement request, provide
        a rationale for the request.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Affected Item</strong>&nbsp;- the affected artifact and version.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Severity</strong> - how severe is this issue (show stopper, nice to have, etc.).
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Priority</strong> - how important it is this request in your opinion.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Depending upon the system you are using, the names of these data elements may differ.&nbsp; However, this information
    is required, in one form or another, to permit a speedy review and disposition of the change request.

              <MainDescription><![CDATA[<h3>
    Introduction
</h3>
<p>
    The key to successful iterative development is ensuring that the development team maximizes stakeholder value and
    minimizes risk early in the lifecycle, while minimizing re-work later.&nbsp; This imposes some constraints on how we
    develop the use-case model.
</p>
<p>
    At one extreme is the classical waterfall approach, which attempts to&nbsp;detail all of the requirements prior to
    design and implementation.&nbsp; This approach delays delivery of stakeholder value and risk reduction unnecessarily.
</p>
<p>
    At the other extreme is&nbsp;beginning development prior to understanding what the system must do.&nbsp; This approach
    results in significant, and costly, re-work later in the lifecycle.
</p>
<p>
    A better approach is to detail only those requirements which will be the focus of development in the next iteration (or
    two).&nbsp; Selection of these requirements is driven by value and risk, and thus requires as a minimum an abstract
    understanding of the "big-picture".
</p>
<p>
    The following discussion will outline the approach used to evolve the use-case model to achieve these goals.
</p>
<h3>
    <a id="How the Use-Case Model Evolves" name="How the Use-Case Model Evolves">How the Use-Case Model Evolves</a>
</h3>
<p>
    The recommended approach to evolving the use-case model takes a "breadth before depth" approach.&nbsp; In this
    approach, one identifies the actors and use cases and outlines them quickly.&nbsp; Based on this knowledge, one can
    then perform an initial assessment of risk and priorities and thus focus the effort of&nbsp;detailing&nbsp;the use
    cases on the right areas.
</p>
<h4>
    Inception
</h4>
<p>
    The purpose of inception is to understand the scope of the system.&nbsp; We need to understand the main purpose of the
    system, what is within the scope of the system, and what is external to the system.&nbsp; We should strive to list all
    the primary actors and use cases, however we don''t have the luxury of being able to detail all of these requirements at
    this time.&nbsp; Strive to&nbsp;identify by name&nbsp;~80% of the primary actors and use cases and provide a brief
    description (one - three sentences) for each.
</p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    <h5>
        Identify Stakeholders
    </h5>
    <p>
        Begin by listing all the external stakeholders for the system.&nbsp; These individuals will be the source of the
        requirements.
    </p>
    <h5>
        Identify Actors
    </h5>
    <p>
        Name and describe the primary actors.&nbsp; See <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../../openup/guidances/guidelines/find_and_outline_actors_and_ucs_BB5516A9.html" guid="_eyL0wCu-EdqSxKAVa9kmvA">Guideline: Find and Outline Actors and Use Cases</a>.
    </p>
    <h5>
        Identify Use Cases
    </h5>
    <p>
        For each actor, ask "what does this actor want to accomplish with the system"?&nbsp; This will reveal the primary
        use cases for the system.&nbsp; Name and describe each of these as you discover them.
    </p>
    <h5>
        Update the Use-Case Model
    </h5>
    <p>
        Update the use case model to capture the actor and use case names and brief description.&nbsp; Capture the
        relationship between the actors and use cases.
    </p>
    <h5>
        Outline the Basic Flows
    </h5>
    <p>
        For those use cases that are considered high priority by the stakeholders, or high risk by the development team,
        capture a step-by-step description of the Basic Flow.&nbsp; Don''t worry about structuring the flow at this
        point.&nbsp; Focus on capturing the dialogue between the actor and the system and the key requirements for the
        system.
    </p>
    <h5>
        Identify Alternate Flows
    </h5>
    <p>
        As you work through the Basic Flows, ask: "What can go wrong?"; "What options are available at this point?";
        etc.&nbsp; These types of questions will reveal alternate flows.&nbsp; Capture these, giving each a name and brief
        description.&nbsp; Fight the urge to detail these alternate flows at this time.
    </p>
    <h5>
        Refactor the Use Case Model
    </h5>
    <p>
        Based on the Basic Flows you have identified, determine if there is common behavior that could be factored out into
        &lt;&lt;include&gt;&gt; use cases.&nbsp; Refactor the Use Case model accordingly.
    </p>
    <h5>
        Prioritize Use Cases
    </h5>
    <p>
        Given the abstract description you now have of the requirements, work with stakeholders to prioritize the use
        cases.&nbsp; This will be the primary input to iteration planning.
    </p>
</blockquote>
<h4>
    Elaboration
</h4>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    <p>
        The purpose of elaboration is to demonstrate the feasibilty of&nbsp;the solution prior to committing additional
        resources.&nbsp; To be successful, one should demonstrate that stakeholder value can be delivered and that the risk
        of continuing is acceptable.&nbsp; We should strive to detail and implement ~20% of the scenarios.&nbsp; These
        scenarios should be selected to achieve good coverage of the architecture (for example, a vertical slice through
        the architecture, touching as many&nbsp;components and interfaces as possible, is preferred to elaborating the GUI
        only).
    </p>
    <h5>
        Detail Basic Flow
    </h5>
    <p>
        For those UC selected for the next iteration, spend the time to detail the basic flow now.&nbsp; See <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../../openup/guidances/guidelines/detail_ucs_and_scenarios_6BC56BB7.html" guid="_4BJ_YCxSEdqjsdw1QLH_6Q">Guideline: Detail Use Cases and Scenarios</a>.
    </p>
    <h5>
        Detail Alternate Flow
    </h5>
    <p>
        For those alternate flows selected for the next iteration, spend the time to detail the flows now.
    </p>
    <h5>
        Update the Use-Case Model
    </h5>
    <p>
        Update the Use-Case Model to capture any refinements made as a result of your work.&nbsp; Depending upon the
        complexity of the system, you may want to introduce packages to group the use cases in a logical manner to simplify
        communications, iteration planning, and parallel development.
    </p>
</blockquote>
<h4>
    Construction
</h4>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">

<h4>
    Transition
</h4>
<p>
    The purpose of transition is to make the system operational in its intended environment.&nbsp; Some requirements will
    still be uncovered at this point, but if we have done things right they should not stress the design.&nbsp; The
    remaining ~5% to ~10% of use cases should be detailed and implemented in this phase.

    <a id="Avoiding Functional Decomposition" name="Avoiding Functional Decomposition">Avoiding Functional
    Decomposition</a>
</h3>
<p>
    A common pitfall for those new to use-case models is to perform a&nbsp;functional decomposition of the system. This
    results in many small "use cases", that on their own do not deliver the "observable result of value" to the
    actor.&nbsp; To avoid this, watch for the following symptoms:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Small</strong> use cases, meaning that the description of the flow of events is only one or a few
        sentences.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Many</strong> use cases, meaning that the number of use cases is some multiple of a hundred, rather than a
        multiple of ten.
    </li>
    <li>
        Use-case names that are constructions such as "do this operation on this particular data" or "do this function with
        this particular data". For example, "Enter Personal Identification Number in an ATM machine" should not be modeled
        as a separate use case for the ATM machine, because no one would use the system to do just this. A use case is a
        complete flow of events that results in something of value to an actor.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    To avoid functional decomposition, make sure that the use-case model helps answer these kinds of questions:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        What is the context of the system?
    </li>
    <li>
        Why are you building this system?
    </li>
    <li>
        What does the user want the system to do?
    </li>
    <li>
        How&nbsp;do the users benefit from the system?
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    <a id="Structuring the Use-Case Model" name="Structuring the Use-Case Model">Structuring the Use-Case Model</a>
</h3>
<p>
    There are three main reasons for structuring the use-case model:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        To make the use cases easier to understand.
    </li>
    <li>
        To partition common behavior described within many use cases.
    </li>
    <li>
        To make the use-case model easier to maintain.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Structuring is not the first thing you do, however. There is no point in structuring the use cases until you know a bit
    more about their behavior than a one-sentence description. You should at least have established a step-by-step outline
    for the flow of events of the use case to make sure that your decisions are based on an accurate understanding of the
    behavior.
</p>
<p>
    There are several advanced modeling concepts available in the literature for&nbsp;structuring the use-case model,
    however, following the principle of "keep-it-simple" only the most useful of these, namely the &lt;&lt;include&gt;&gt;
    relationship is discussed in this process.&nbsp; This relationship permits one to factor out common behavior into a
    separate use case that is "include" in other use cases.&nbsp; See <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../../openup/guidances/concepts/use_case_model_CD178AF9.html" guid="_2jyfUAhVEduRe8TeoBmuGg">Concept: Use-Case Model</a>&nbsp;for more&nbsp;details.
</p>
<p>
    Another aspect of&nbsp;structuring the use-case model for easier understanding is grouping the use cases into packages.
    The use-case model can be organized as a hierarchy of use-case packages. For more information on use-case packages, see
    <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../../openup/guidances/concepts/use_case_model_CD178AF9.html" guid="_2jyfUAhVEduRe8TeoBmuGg">Concept: Use-Case Model</a>.
</p>
<h3>
    <a id="Use Cases Are Always Related to Actors" name="Use Cases Are Always Related to Actors">Relationship Between Use
    Cases and Actors</a>
</h3>
<p>
    Running each use case includes communication with one or more actors. A use-case instance is always started by an actor
    asking the system to do something. This implies that every use case should have communicates-associations with actors.
    The reason for this rule is to enforce that the system provides only the functionality that users need and nothing
    else. Having use cases that no one requests is an indication that something is wrong in the use-case model or in the
    requirements.
</p>
<p>
    However, there are some exceptions to this rule:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        An&nbsp;"included" use case might not interact with an actor if the base use case does.
    </li>
    <li>
        A use case may be initiated according to a schedule (for example, once a week or once a day), which means that the
        system clock is the initiator. The system clock is internal to the system; therefore, the use case is not initiated
        by an actor but by an internal system event. If no other actor interaction occurs in the use case, it will not have
        any associations to actors. However, for clarity, you can use "time" as an actor to show how the use case is
        initiated in your use-case diagrams. <strong>CAUTION:</strong> if you have a lot of "time" actors in your model,
        challenge them.&nbsp; Perhaps you missed a real actor, such as an administrator responsible for scheduling reports,
        etc.

              <MainDescription><![CDATA[<h3>
    Explanation
</h3>
<p>
    A use-case model is a model of how different types of users interact with the system to solve a problem.&nbsp; As such,
    it describes the goals of the users, the interactions between the users and the system, and the required behavior of
    the system in satisfying these goals.
</p>
<p>
    A use-case model consists of a number of model elements.&nbsp; The most important model elements are: use cases, actors
    and the relationships between them.
</p>
<p>
    A use-case diagram is used to graphically depict a subset of the model to simplify communications.&nbsp; There will
    typically be several use-case diagrams associated with a given model, each showing a subset of the model elements
    relevant for a particular purpose.&nbsp; The same model element may be shown on several use-case diagrams, but each
    instance must be consistent.&nbsp; If tools are used to maintain the use-case model, this consistency constraint is
    automated so that any changes to the model element (changing the name for example) will be automatically reflected on
    every use-case diagram that shows that element.
</p>
<p>
    The use-case model may contain packages that are used to structure the model to simplify analysis, communications,
    navigation, development, maintenance and planning.
</p>
<p>
    Much of the use-case model is in fact textual, with the text captured in the&nbsp;<a class="elementLink"
    href="./../../../openup/guidances/templates/uc_specification.html" guid="_0cpNwMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">Use-Case
    Specification</a>s that are associated with each use-case model element.&nbsp;These specifications describe the flow of
    events of the use case.
</p>
<p>
    The use-case model serves as a unifying thread throughout system development. It is used as the primary specification
    of the functional requirements for the system, as the basis for analysis and design, as an input to iteration planning,
    as the basis of defining test cases and as the basis for user documentation&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<h3>
    Basic model elements
</h3>
<p>
    The use-case model contains, as a minimum, the following basic model elements.
</p>
<h4>
    Actor
</h4>
<p>
    A model element representing&nbsp;each actor. Properties include the actors name and brief description. See&nbsp;<a
    class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../../openup/guidances/concepts/actor.html"
    guid="_zGqO0MDpEduTGJ8i4u8TMw">Concept: Actor</a> for more information.
</p>
<h4>
    Use Case
</h4>
<p>
    A model element representing&nbsp;each use case. Properties include the use case name and use case specification. See
    <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../../openup/workproducts/use_case-2.html"
    guid="_0VGbUMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">Artifact: Use Case</a> and <a class="elementLinkWithType"
    href="./../../../openup/guidances/concepts/use_case-4.html" guid="_KudM0NcJEdqz_d2XWoVt6Q">Concept: Use Case</a> for
    more information.
</p>
<h4>
    Associations
</h4>
<p>
    Associations are used to describe the relationships between actors and the use cases they participate in. This
    relationship is commonly known as a “communicates-association”.
</p>
<h3>
    Advanced model elements
</h3>
<p>
    The use-case model may also contain the following advanced model elements.
</p>
<h4>
    Subject
</h4>
<p>
    A model element that represents the boundary of the system of interest.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<h4>
    Use-Case Package
</h4>
<p>
    A model element used to structure the use case model to simplify analysis, communications, navigation, and
    planning.&nbsp; If there are many use cases or actors, you can use use-case packages to further structure the use-case
    model in much the same manner you use folders or directories to structure the information on your hard-disk.
</p>
<p>
    You can partition a use-case model into use-case packages for several reasons, including:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        To reflect the order, configuration, or delivery units in the finished system thus supporting iteration planning.
    </li>
    <li>
        To support parallel development by dividing the problem into bite-sized pieces.
    </li>
    <li>
        To simplify communication with different stakeholders by creating packages for containing use cases and actors
        relevant to a particular stakeholder.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    Generalizations
</h4>
<p>
    A relationship&nbsp;between actors to support re-use of common properties.
</p>
<h4>
    Dependencies
</h4>
<p>
    A number of dependency types between use cases are defined in UML. In particular, &lt;&lt;extend&gt;&gt; and
    &lt;&lt;include&gt;&gt;.
</p>
<p>
    &lt;&lt;extend&gt;&gt; is used to include optional behavior from an extending use case in an extended use case.
</p>
<p>
    &lt;&lt;include&gt;&gt; is used to include common behavior from an included use case into a base use case in order to
    support re-use of common behavior.
</p>
<p>
    The latter is the most widely used dependency and is useful for:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Factoring out behavior from the base use case that is not necessary for the understanding of the primary purpose of
        the use case to simplify communications.
    </li>
    <li>
        Factoring out behavior that is in common for two or more use cases to maximize re-use, simplify maintenance and
        ensure consistency.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    Example Use-Case Diagram
</h3>
<p>
    Figure 1 shows a use-case diagram from an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) use-case model.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp;<img height="410" alt="Figure 1: ATM Use-Case Diagram" src="openup/guidances/concepts/resources/atm_uc_diagram.GIF" width="565" />
</p>
<p>
    Figure 1: ATM Use-Case Diagram
</p>
<p>
    This diagram shows the subject (atm:ATM), four actors (Bank Customer, Bank, Cahier and Maintenance Person), five use
    cases (Withdraw Cash, Transfer Funds, Deposit Funds, Refill Machine and Validate User), three &lt;&lt;includes&gt;&gt;
    dependencies, and the associations between the performing actors and the use cases.
</p>
<p>
    The use cases Withdraw Cash, Deposit Funds, and Transfer Funds all need to include how the customer is identified to
    the system. This behavior can be extracted to a new inclusion use case called Validate User, which the three base use
    cases &lt;&lt;include&gt;&gt;. The base use cases are independent of the method used for identification, and it is
    therefore encapsulated in the inclusion use case. From the perspective of the base use cases, it does not matter
    whether the method for identification is to read a magnetic bank card, or perform a retinal scan. They only depend on
    the result of Validate Customer.
</p>
<p>
    Note that Figure 1 is only a partial view of the use-case model. The complete use-case model also includes descriptions
    of each actor, descriptions of each use case, and use-case specifications for each use case.&nbsp; For a more complete
    example of this use case model see <a class="elementLinkWithType"

              <Description>Avoid rushing into defining the solution. First, gain agreement on the definition of the problem by asking the stakeholders&#xD;
what they see as the problem. Then search for root causes, or the “problem behind the problem.”&#xD;
Use&amp;nbsp;techniques&amp;nbsp;like the ones&amp;nbsp;described in&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;elementlinkwithtype&quot; href=&quot;./../../openup/guidances/guidelines/req_gathering_techniques_8CB8E44C.html&quot; guid=&quot;_OnoNQNSAEdmLhZ9H5Plxyw&quot;>Guideline: Requirements Gathering Techniques&lt;/a>. Formulate the problem statement, and then fill in the corresponding section from &lt;a class=&quot;elementlinkwithtype&quot; href=&quot;./../../openup/guidances/templates/vision_C2DEEF73.html&quot; guid=&quot;_0cW54MlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw&quot;>Template: Vision&lt;/a>.

Each one is applicable in a particular&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    If you can meet stakeholders in person, then you can conduct an interview or a brainstorming session. This face to face&#xD;
    collaboration is extremely valuable and reduces the chances of the project team misunderstanding the needs of the&#xD;
    stakeholders.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Some requirements may already be documented in an existing Work Item List. This can often be used as a solid starting&#xD;
    position from which a full set of requirements can be created.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Any requirements gathered during this step should be captured in the Work Item List.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

            <MainDescription><![CDATA[<h1>
    Sources of requirements
</h1>
<p>
    Good requirements start with good sources. Finding those high-quality sources is an important task and, fortunately,
    one that takes few resources.
</p>
<p>
    The primary sources of requirements are the <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../openup/roles/stakeholder.html"
    target="_blank" guid="_dTa6gMAYEdqX-s4mWhkyqQ">Stakeholder</a>s, so begin by identifying them from among these
    candidates:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Customers
    </li>
    <li>
        Users
    </li>
    <li>
        Administrators
    </li>
    <li>
        Maintenance&nbsp;staff
    </li>
    <li>
        Partners
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Ask each stakeholder to identify other stakeholders. By “peeling the onion” in this manner you can quickly identify all
    stakeholders so that you don''t miss important perspectives and associated requirements.&nbsp; This&nbsp;will help you
    identify and resolve conflicting requirements as early as possible.
</p>
<p>
    These are other possible sources of ideas for requirements:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Domain experts
    </li>
    <li>
        Industry analysts
    </li>
    <li>
        Information about competitors
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The last item often includes information about the current system that competitors are using to solve the business
    problem.
</p>
<h1>
    Requirements-gathering techniques
</h1>
<p>
    After you have identified these sources, there are several techniques that you can use to gather requirements (also see
    <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../openup/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.html#TEL06"
    guid="_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg">[TEL06]</a>). However, it is important to recognize that requirement gathering is an
    iterative process, and there is no single technique that is universally applicable <a
    href="./../../../openup/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.html#HIC03"
    guid="_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg">[HIC03]</a>.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Success tips:</strong><br />
    Do it now, keep it small, and iterate.
</p>
<p>
    Capture requirements, and then collaborate with the stakeholders to correct and improve them. You can capture
    requirements in one or more of these ways:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Conduct a brainstorming session
    </li>
    <li>
        Interview users
    </li>
    <li>
        Work in the target environment
    </li>
    <li>
        Study analogous systems
    </li>
    <li>
        Examine suggestions and problem reports
    </li>
    <li>
        Talk to support teams
    </li>
    <li>
        Study improvements made by users
    </li>
    <li>
        Look for unintended uses
    </li>
    <li>
        Conduct collaborative workshops
    </li>
    <li>
        Demonstrate prototypes to stakeholders
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>
    Conduct a brainstorming session
</h2>
<p>
    Brainstorming is a short group session where all participants are allowed to say whatever they feel is important to the
    topic of discussion. After that, a facilitator leads the group in organizing and prioritizing the results. The
    following basic rules for brainstorming ensures better results:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Start out by clearly stating the objective of the brainstorming session.
    </li>
    <li>
        Generate as many ideas as possible.
    </li>
    <li>
        Let your imagination soar.
    </li>
    <li>
        Do not allow criticism or debate while you are gathering information.
    </li>
    <li>
        After you have gathered information,&nbsp;reshape and combine ideas.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>
    Interview users
</h2>
<p>
    Face-to-face contact with users through individual interviews is the primary source of requirements and an important
    way to gather and validate their requirements. Remember that it is not the only possible technique and that you can
    conduct interviews many different ways. Develop a repertoire of styles to fit different situations. Unless you use the
    system yourself, you will need to make an effort to understand and experience the user''s problem to describe it clearly
    and correctly.
</p>
<p>
    Start with unstructured interviews to gain an understanding of the work environment.&nbsp; Ask stakeholders about their
    jobs and the problems that they face. Structured interviews, using a prepared set of questions, can be used later to
    fill in the gaps of your knowledge.
</p>
<h2>
    Work in the target environment
</h2>
<p>
    Experience the work of the users for yourself. Working with users helps you understand problems that have resisted
    previous solutions. Familiar systems that were developed in this way inevitably include tools for programmers, such as
    interactive editors and compilers, because the developers naturally have both the expertise in the subject area and the
    desire to solve their own problems. It would be good to see the same dedication devoted to solving problems in other
    areas too. Where the work cannot easily be experienced in this way, it may still be possible to do a bit more than just
    sit quietly and observe. Users can give you a commentary on what they are doing, what the problems are, and what they
    would like to have to make the work easier.
</p>
<h2>
    Study analogous systems
</h2>
<p>
    The starting point for many projects is often a similar or an existing system. Sometimes, comparable products and
    systems contain working versions of good ideas for solving user problems. You can save the time and avoid reinventing
    the wheel by looking at systems already on the market, whether they are systems installed at the user''s site or
    products made by rival organizations. Even if they are trying to solve slightly different problems, they
    often&nbsp;provide valuable clues about what you need to do.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<h2>
    Examine suggestions and problem reports
</h2>
<p>
    Requirements can come from change suggestions and user problems. A direct road way to find requirements is to look at
    suggestions and problems as they were first described. Most organizations have a form for reporting system problems or
    software defects. You can ask to look through those reports (there will probably be many). Sort them into groups so
    that you can identify the key areas that are troubling users. Ask users questions about these areas to clarify the
    users'' actual needs.
</p>
<p>
    If there is an existing&nbsp;<a class="elementLink" href="./../../../openup/workproducts/work_items_list.html"
    guid="_rGNWsCbSEdqh1LYUOGRh2A">Work Items List</a> from a previous release, or even from a similar project, review the
    list for potential requirements that may apply to the current development project. If you''re lucky, you may be able to
    re-use some of that code as well!
</p>
<h2>
    Talk to support teams
</h2>
<p>
    Most large sales organizations have a help desk that keeps a log of problems and fixes, and support engineers who do
    the fixing. Many organizations have similar facilities to support their own operations. Talking to the help desk staff
    and the support engineers may give you good leads into the requirements, and save you time. Also talk to the training
    team and installation teams about what users find to be&nbsp;difficult.
</p>
<h2>
    Study improvements made by users
</h2>
<p>
    This is an excellent source of requirements. Users of a standard company spreadsheet may have added a few fields, or
    combined different sheets, or drawn a graph that exactly meets their individual needs. You just need to ask: Why did
    you add that? Their answers help you get to the heart of the actual requirement.
</p>
<h2>
    Look for unintended uses
</h2>
<p>
    People often use things for purposes other than what the designers intended. This is&nbsp;a good way to get new ideas
    and to think of innovations. For example, an observant product manager noticed that an engineer was staying in the
    office late to use an advanced computer-aided design system to design a new kitchen layout for his home. Inexpensive
    commercial products are now widely available for home use.
</p>
<h2>
    Conduct collaborative workshops
</h2>
<p>
    Collaborative workshops can help you pull together a good set of requirements quickly. In two to five days, you can
    create a set of requirements, and then review and improve them. If everyone in a workshop tries to estimate the cost
    and value of each requirement, the outcome is much more useful and cost-effective.
</p>
<p>
    Collaborative workshops are quicker and better at discovering requirements than other techniques, such
    as&nbsp;one-on-one interviews. You are bringing the right collection of people together and getting them to correct,
    improve, and reach consensus on their requirements.
</p>
<p>
    A workshop is inherently expensive because of the number of people involved, but it saves a significant amount of time.
    If you can define the product right the first time and cut three months off the requirements gathering, the savings
    could be enormous. The workshop has to be thoroughly organized to take advantage of people''s time.
</p>
<p>
    Choose a quiet location for the workshop so that people are not disturbed by day-to-day business. Discourage mobile
    phones, but arrange to take messages. Take advantage of informal interactions by choosing a site so that people aren''t
    likely to go home at night or to go out separately.
</p>
<p>
    The example in the following figure shows the logic of a requirements workshop. Notice that the workshop provides the
    environment in which to apply other requirements-gathering techniques, such as brainstorming.

<h2>
    Demonstrate prototypes to stakeholders
</h2>
<p>
    Prototypes and models are an excellent way of presenting ideas to users, because they allow people to immediately see
    some aspects of the system. Showing users a simple prototype can provoke&nbsp;them into giving good requirements
    information or changing their minds about existing requirements. Prototypes can illustrate how an approach might work
    or give users a glimpse of what they might be able to do. More requirements are likely to emerge when users see what
    you are suggesting.
</p>
<p>
    A presentation can use a sequence of slides, a story board, an artist''s impression, or even an animation to give users
    a vision of the possibilities. When prototyping software, make a mock-up of the user interface screens, emphasizing
    that there is no code and that the system has not been designed or even specified yet. <b>Fair warning:</b> A mock-up
    can set expectations that may be difficult to meet.
</p>
<p>
    This prototyping aims to get users to mention what may turn out to be missing requirements. You are not trying to sell
    users an idea or product. Instead, you are finding out what they actually want. Seeing a prototype, which invariably is
    wrong in some ways and right in others, is a powerful stimulus to users to start saying what they want. They may point
    out plenty of problems with the prototype. This is excellent, because each problem leads to a new requirement.

            <MainDescription><![CDATA[<h1> Finding Actors </h1>
<p> Find the external entities with which the system under development must interact. 
  Candidates include groups of users who will require help from the system to 
  perform their tasks and to execute the system''s primary or secondary functions, 
  as well as external hardware, software, and other systems. </p>
<p> Define each candidate Actor by naming it and writing a brief description. 
  Include the Actor''s area of responsibility and the goals that the Actor will 
  attempt to accomplish when using the system. Eliminate Actor candidates who 
  do not have any goals. For more information on Actors and their properties, 
  see <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../../openup/guidances/concepts/actor_411726C.html" guid="_zGqO0MDpEduTGJ8i4u8TMw">Concept: 
  Actor</a>. </p>
<p> These questions are useful for identifying Actors: </p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Who will supply, use, or remove information from the system?
    </li>
    <li>
        Who will use the system?
    </li>
    <li>
        Who is interested in a certain feature or service provided by the system?
    </li>
    <li>
        Who will support and maintain the system?
    </li>
    <li>
        What are the system''s external resources?
    </li>
    <li>
        What other systems will need to interact with the system under development?
    </li>
</ul>
<p> Review the list of stakeholders that you captured in the Vision Statement. 
  Not all stakeholders will be Actors (meaning, they will not all interact directly 
  with the system under development), but this list of stakeholders is useful 
  for identifying candidates for Actors. </p>
<h1> Finding likely use cases </h1>
<p>
    The best way to find use cases is to consider what each Actor requires of the system. For each Actor, human or not,
    ask:
</p>
<ul>
    
  <li> What are the goals that the Actor will attempt to achieve with the system? 
  </li>
    <li>
        What are the primary tasks that the Actor wants the system to perform?
    </li>
    <li>
        Will the Actor create, store, change, remove, or read data in the system?
    </li>
    <li>
        Will the Actor need to inform the system about sudden external changes?
    </li>
    
  <li> Does the Actor need to be informed about certain occurrences in the system, 
    such as unavailability of a network? </li>
    <li>
        Will the Actor perform a system startup or shutdown?
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Understanding how&nbsp;the target&nbsp;organization works and how this information system might be incorporated into
    existing operations gives an idea of system''s surroundings. That information may reveal other use case candidates.
</p>
<p> Give a unique name and brief description that clearly describes the goals 
  for each use case. If the candidate use case does not have goals, ask yourself 
  why it exists, and then either identify a purpose for it or eliminate the use 
  case. For more information on use cases and their properties, see <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../../openup/guidances/concepts/use_case_BB199D1B.html" guid="_KudM0NcJEdqz_d2XWoVt6Q">Concept: 
  Use Case</a>. </p>
<h1> Outlining use cases </h1>
<p> Without going into details, write a first draft of the flow of events of the 
  use cases identified as high-priority. Initially, write a simple step-by-step 
  description of the basic flow of the use case. The step-by-step description 
  is a simple ordered list of interactions between the Actor and the system. For 
  example, the description of the basic flow of the Withdraw Cash use case of 
  an automated teller machine (ATM) would be something like this: </p>
<ol>
    <li>
        The&nbsp;customer inserts a bank card.
    </li>
    <li>
        The system validates the card and prompts the person to enter a personal identification number (PIN).
    </li>
    <li>
        The customer&nbsp;enters a PIN.
    </li>
    <li>
        The system validates the PIN and prompts the customer to select an action.
    </li>
    <li>
        The customer selects Withdraw Cash.
    </li>
    <li>
        The system prompts the customer to choose which account.
    </li>
    <li>
        The customer selects the checking account.
    </li>
    <li>
        The system prompts for an amount.
    </li>
    <li>
        The customer enters the amount to withdraw.
    </li>
    
  <li> The system validates the amount (assuming sufficient funds), and then issues 
    cash and a receipt. </li>
    <li>
        The customer takes the cash and receipt, and then retrieves the bank card.
    </li>
    <li>
        The use case ends.
    </li>
</ol>
<p> As you create this step-by-step description of the basic flow of events, you 
  may discover alternative and exceptional flows. For example, what happens if 
  the customer enters an invalid PIN? Capture each alternative flow that you identified 
  so that you don''t forget them. You can fill in the details later. See <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../../openup/guidances/examples/uc_model_evolve_960F136B.html" guid="_t4QdAMNqEdu2IdAIaWZyAw">Example: 
  Evolution of the Use-Case Model</a>&nbsp;for more information on how the use 
  cases evolve. </p>
<h1> Relationships between Actors and use cases </h1>
<p> The relationship between Actors and use cases should be captured, or documented&nbsp; 
  There are several ways to do this. If you are using a use-case model on the 
  project, you can create use-case diagrams to show how&nbsp;Actors and use cases&nbsp;relate 
  to each other. See <a href="./../../../openup/guidances/guidelines/uc_model_4C64E97D.html" guid="_0VAUsMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">Guideline: 
  Use-Case Model</a>&nbsp;for more information. </p>
<p>
    If you are not using a use-case model for the project, make sure that each use case identifies the associated primary
    and secondary Actors.

            <MainDescription><![CDATA[<h1>
    Most efficient way to write use cases
</h1>
<p>
    Because use cases model requirements, they are highly dynamic by nature. The more we examine a scenario, the more we
    learn and the more things change. To further complicate the issue, changes to one use case can lead to changes in
    others. Therefore, we want a flexible, highly efficient method for writing use cases that maximizes stakeholder value
    and minimizes risk early in the project and minimizes costly rework later.
</p>
<p>
    An iterative, breadth-before-depth approach is best. This breadth-first approach involves two aspects: finding and
    outlining use cases and detailing individual use cases.

<p>
    Use cases exist in sets, and the relationships between the various use cases and Actors are important. As you learn
    more about the Actors, you also learn more about the system''s boundaries and transactions. Likewise, as you learn more
    about the system''s transactions, you learn more about its Actors. Therefore, it is more efficient to capture and
    outline the primary use cases before detailing individual use cases. This way, you can identify and understand the
    importance and risk associated with each use case before committing time to detailing them.&nbsp; This aspect of the
    breadth-before-depth approach is embodied in the process by the explicit separation of two tasks <a class="elementLink"
    href="./../../../openup/tasks/find_and_outline_requirements.html" guid="_P9cMUPV_EdmdHa9MmVPgqQ">Find and Outline
    Requirements</a>&nbsp;and <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../openup/tasks/detail_requirements.html"
    guid="_0e1mIMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">Detail Requirements</a>.&nbsp;
</p>
<h2>
    Detailing individual use cases
</h2>
<p>
    Similarly, it makes sense to write each individual use case iteratively. Start by detailing the main scenario.&nbsp; As
    you do this, you can identify various alternative and error flows that the use case might follow, and then evaluate,
    rearrange, or eliminate them and prioritize them before detailing the surviving scenarios, so you can focus your effort
    in the right place.
</p>
<p>
    The level of detail that you capture depends on several factors. See <a class="elementLinkWithType"
    href="./../../../openup/guidances/guidelines/use_case_formats.html" guid="_qq0GMAXkEduj_7BEUj1JfQ">Guideline: Use Case
    Formats</a> for guidance on selecting the correct format for your use cases.
</p>
<h3>
    Detail the basic flow of events (main scenario)
</h3>
<p>
    As a starting point, use the step-by-step description of the main scenario that you created during <a
    class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../../openup/tasks/find_and_outline_requirements.html"
    guid="_P9cMUPV_EdmdHa9MmVPgqQ">Task: Find and Outline Requirements</a>. Then, gradually add details to this scenario,
    describing <strong>what</strong> the use case does, <strong>not how</strong> to solve problems internal to the system.
</p>
<p>
    A flow of events description covers:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        How and when the use case starts
    </li>
    <li>
        When the use case interacts with the Actors and what data they exchange
    </li>
    <li>
        When the use case uses data stored in the system or stores data in the system
    </li>
    <li>
        How and when the use case ends
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    It does not describe:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The GUI
    </li>
    <li>
        Technical details of hardware or software
    </li>
    <li>
        Design issues
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Describe the flow of events for the main scenario in the form:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        The use case starts when &lt;Actor name&gt; &lt;does something&gt;.
    </li>
    <li>
        The system &lt;does something in response&gt;.
    </li>
    <li>
        The &lt;Actor name&gt; does something else.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    See Section 4 of&nbsp;<a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../../openup/guidances/examples/use_case_spec.html"
    guid="_JLOiIMNvEdu2IdAIaWZyAw">Example: Use-Case Specification</a> for a sample completed basic flow.
</p>
<h3>
    Detail alternate flows
</h3>
<p>
    A use case consists of a number of scenarios, each representing specific instances of the use case that correspond to
    specific inputs from the Actor or to specific conditions in the environment. Each scenario describes alternate ways
    that the system behaves, or it may describe failure or exception cases.
</p>
<p>
    Review the list of alternative flows that you captured during <a class="elementLinkWithType"
    href="./../../../openup/tasks/find_and_outline_requirements.html" guid="_P9cMUPV_EdmdHa9MmVPgqQ">Task: Find and Outline
    Requirements</a>. As you detail the main scenario, you may identify additional alternate flows by asking these
    questions:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Are there different options available, depending on input from the Actor? (Example: If the Actor enters an invalid
        PIN number while accessing an ATM.)
    </li>
    <li>
        What business rules may come into play? (Example: The Actor requests more money from the ATM than is available in
        her account.)
    </li>
    <li>
        What could go wrong? (Example: No network connection available when required to perform a transaction.)
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    It is best to develop these scenarios iteratively, as well.
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Begin by identifying them.
    </li>
    <li>
        Examine each possible scenario to determine whether it is relevant, that it can actually happen, and that it is
        distinct from other scenarios.
    </li>
    <li>
        Eliminate redundant or unnecessary scenarios.
    </li>
    <li>
        Prioritize the remaining scenarios and start detailing the more important ones.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    In addition to the detailing the flow of events of each alternative flow in the form described above, each alternative
    flow should describe:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Where the alternative flow can be inserted in the basic flow of events
    </li>
    <li>
        The condition that needs to be fulfilled for the alternative behavior to start
    </li>
    <li>
        How and where the basic flow of events is resumed, or how the use case ends
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    See Section 5 of&nbsp;<a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../../openup/guidances/examples/use_case_spec.html"
    guid="_JLOiIMNvEdu2IdAIaWZyAw">Example: Use-Case Specification</a> for examples of completed alternative flows.
</p>
<h2>
    Structure the use case
</h2>
<p>
    It is useful to structure the use case according to scenarios. This helps both to simplify communication and
    maintenance and to permit the use cases to be implemented iteratively. Name and describe each key scenario so that
    these may be prioritized, assigned to an iteration and an individual, and referenced from the&nbsp;<a
    class="elementLink" href="./../../../openup/workproducts/work_items_list.html" guid="_rGNWsCbSEdqh1LYUOGRh2A">Work
    Items List</a> for implementation.
</p>
<p>
    In addition to structuring the use cases according to scenarios, it is often useful to structure the scenarios
    themselves into subflows. This provides an additional level of granularity for planning work and tracking progress.
    Unless a subflow involves only a minor part of the complete flow of events (which can be described in the body of the
    text), describe each subflow in a separate section of the Flow of Events section. Subflows that should be in a separate
    section include these examples:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Subflows that occupy a large segment of a given flow of events.
    </li>
    <li>
        Exceptional and alternative flows of events. This helps the use case''s basic flow of events to stand out more
        clearly.
    </li>
    <li>
        Any subflow that can be run at several intervals in the same flow of events.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    If there are subflows identified that are common to multiple use cases, you can re-factor your use-case model to
    include these. See&nbsp;<a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../../openup/guidances/concepts/use_case_model.html"
    guid="_2jyfUAhVEduRe8TeoBmuGg">Concept: Use-Case Model</a> for more information on the &lt;&lt;include&gt;&gt;
    dependency.
</p>
<p>
    For more information on structuring the use case, see the "Flow of Events - Structure" section&nbsp;in <a
    class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../../openup/guidances/concepts/use_case-2.html"
    guid="_KudM0NcJEdqz_d2XWoVt6Q">Concept: Use Case</a>.

<p>
    The&nbsp;<a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../../openup/guidances/templates/uc_specification.html"
    guid="_0cpNwMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">Template: Use-Case Specification</a> provides a suggested structure for the use case
    specification. See&nbsp;<a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../../openup/guidances/examples/uc_model_evolve.html"

    Specification</a> for examples of structuring the use-case model and use case specifications, respectively.
</p>
<h2>
    Detail special requirements
</h2>
<p>
    Be sure to also capture any requirements that are related to the use case but are not taken into consideration in the
    flow of events of the use case.&nbsp;These requirements include business rules, design constraints, usability
    requirements, performance requirements, reliability requirements, supportability requirements, and interface
    requirements. These requirements all influence the implementation and associated cost as much as the flow of events.
    Therefore, they must be agreed upon and prioritized.
</p>
<p>
    Typically, nonfunctional requirements that refer to a specific use case are captured in the Special Requirements
    section of the use case. For more information, see the "Special Requirements" section in <a class="elementLinkWithType"
    href="./../../../openup/guidances/concepts/use_case-2.html" guid="_KudM0NcJEdqz_d2XWoVt6Q">Concept: Use Case</a>.
</p>
<p>
    If there are nonfunctional requirements that apply to more than one use case, capture these in the <a
    class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../../openup/workproducts/supporting_requirements_spec-2.html"
    guid="_BVh9cL-CEdqb7N6KIeDL8Q">Artifact: Supporting Requirements Specification</a>. For more information on supporting

</p>
<h2>
    Describe preconditions and post-conditions
</h2>
<p>
    A <strong>precondition</strong> of a use case explains the state that the system must be in for the use case to be able
    to start. Be careful in describing the system state. Avoid describing the detail of other, incidental activities that
    may already have taken place.
</p>
<p>
    A <strong>post-condition</strong> of a use case lists possible states that the system can be in after the use case
    runs. The system must be in one of those states. A post-condition also states actions that the system performs at the
    end of the use case, regardless of what occurred in the use case. Post-conditions may be categorized as Minimal
    Guarantees&nbsp;or Success Guarantees:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Minimal Guarantees</b> represent conditions that will be true when the use cases end, regardless of how they
        terminate.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Success Guarantees</b> represent condition that will be true when the use cases end successfully, regardless of
        which paths they took.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Consider the following when specifying preconditions and post-condition:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The states described by pre- or post-conditions should be states that the user can observe. "The user has logged on
        to the system" or "The user has opened the document" are examples of observable states.
    </li>
    <li>
        A precondition is a constraint on when a use case can start. It is not the event that starts the use case.
    </li>
    <li>
        A precondition for a use case is not a precondition for only one subflow, although you can define preconditions and
        post-conditions at the subflow level.
    </li>
    <li>
        A post-condition for a use case should be true regardless of which alternative flows were executed; it should not
        be true only for the main flow. If something could fail, you would cover that in the post-condition by saying "The
        action has completed," or if something failed, "The action was not performed," rather than just "The action is
        completed."&nbsp;
    </li>
</ul>

            <MainDescription><![CDATA[<p>
    The cost of correcting errors increases exponentially throughout the development lifecycle <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../openup/guidances/supportingmaterials/references_6CCF393.html#BOE88" guid="_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg">[BOE88]</a>. Therefore, it is important to discover problems early enough to solve them
    quickly and inexpensively.
</p>
<p>
    Requirements reviews are intended to discover problems with the <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../openup/guidances/concepts/requirements_8006414F.html" guid="_0Wh-sMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">Requirements</a>&nbsp;before you spend significant time and work in implementing the
    wrong thing. This is not to say that you must have a complete set of requirements before implementation, but be sure to
    review, internally and with stakeholders, those that are selected for implementation in the early iterations and those
    that will have a broad impact on the system (often called <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../openup/guidances/concepts/architecturally_significant_requirements_1EE5D757.html" guid="_HrZGIA4MEduibvKwrGxWxA">Architecturally Significant Requirements</a>) to ensure everyone''s concurrence before
    investing significant effort in implementation.
</p>
<h4>
    Informal reviews
</h4>
<p>
    Requirements reviews can be informal, such as simply showing draft requirements to your colleagues or demonstrating a
    prototype.
</p>
<p>
    These informal reviews are excellent for getting the structure of the requirements correct and removing obvious
    mistakes. By keeping the review team small, it is easier to make rapid progress. However, informal reviews can miss
    important perspectives&nbsp;of&nbsp;critical stakeholders.
</p>
<h4>
    Formal reviews
</h4>
<p>
    Requirement reviews can be formal meetings. Start with careful preparation, so that you receive and organize comments
    before the meeting. The meeting itself should produce decisions on all review items. After the meeting, you must pursue
    the review actions to completion. If these actions involve a substantial amount of work or require a change to an
    artifact that is under configuration control, consider submitting <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../openup/guidances/concepts/change_requests_AD4868FE.html" guid="_6jdvECb3Edqh1LYUOGRh2A">Change Requests</a> to prioritize and track the work. See&nbsp;<a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../../openup/tasks/request_change_A048C387.html" guid="_0mwzEclgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">Task: Request Change</a>&nbsp;and the associated&nbsp;<a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../../openup/guidances/guidelines/submitting_change_requests_7A1FE1A6.html" guid="_fnZj0NVXEdqy9sbRhejO5Q">Guideline: Submitting Change Requests</a>&nbsp;for more information on change requests.
</p>
<p>
    Formal reviews are more wide-ranging and expensive. They provide for more balanced reviews from multiple
    perspectives.&nbsp; However, formal reviews involve more people, which makes them more difficult to coordinate (thus
    the need for formality) and expensive in terms of work hours.
</p>
<h4>
    Two-tier reviews
</h4>
<p>
    One technique to get the best of both worlds is to use staged, or "two-tier", reviews&nbsp;<a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../openup/guidances/supportingmaterials/references_6CCF393.html#ADO03" guid="_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg">[ADO03]</a>. The&nbsp;first tier is informal and performed by a smaller team, possibly
    many times. The second&nbsp;tier is more formal and performed by the complete group, perhaps only once.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>First-tier review:</strong> The authors of the requirements and the development team&nbsp;review the
    requirements during the first-tier reviews to ensure that they are&nbsp;unambiguous, complete&nbsp;and
    consistent.&nbsp; It is important to include testers and developers to ensure that the requirements are verifiable and
    feasible.&nbsp;These reviews&nbsp;determine whether the requirements are ready for the larger community to
    review.&nbsp; First-tier reviews may be informal, formal, or a combination of the two.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Second-tier review:</strong> Involve the larger group during the higher-tier review to get more minds working
    on the problem and to achieve concurrence that the requirements are suitable for implementation and validation.&nbsp;
    It is best to have one formal requirement review at the Lifecycle Objective (LCO) milestone and, optionally, one at the
    Lifecycle Architecture (LCA) milestone if significant changes have occurred that introduce unacceptable risk.
</p>
<p>
    At both stages, these two resources will be helpful: <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../../openup/guidances/checklists/good_requirements_594ACCBD.html" guid="_jxn9EO0HEdqHTdbLTmC5IQ">Checklist: Qualities of Good Requirements</a>&nbsp;and <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../../openup/guidances/checklists/use_case_C5362874.html" guid="_0kNwINk1Edq2Q8qZoWbvGA">Checklist: Use Case</a>
</p>
<p>
    Tiered reviews offer several benefits:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Eliminate the noise caused by minor edits during the first-tier reviews, allowing subsequent reviews to focus on
        functionality
    </li>
    <li>
        Provide a professional look to the requirements, presenting both the requirements and their authors in the best
        possible light
    </li>
    <li>
        Safeguard the time of stakeholders who are reviewing the requirements, thus preventing "review burnout", or
        diminished effectiveness from overload and stress
    </li>
    <li>
        Provide the best opportunity for full, effective reviews.
    </li>
</ol>
<h4>
    Golden rules of reviewing
</h4>
<p>
    Follow these golden&nbsp;rules of reviewing <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../openup/guidances/supportingmaterials/references_6CCF393.html#TEL06" guid="_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg">[TEL06]</a>:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <strong>Encourage criticism:</strong> Remember that people are improving the requirements, not criticizing you.
        Even the harshest criticism often contains a grain of truth. Adopt the attitude that every suggestion is a gift.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Choose your best reviewers:</strong> A few specific people make the best reviewers, time and again.
        Cultivate them.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Allow adequate time:</strong> It''s not over until you have agreed upon and made the corrections.<br />

    There is a finite set of requirements to consider when it comes to gathering system-wide requirements, qualities, or
    constraints. Many of them are unfamiliar to stakeholders; therefore, they may find it difficult to answer questions
    related to topics such as availability, performance, scalability, or localization. You can use this guideline and the
    associated checklist <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../../openup/guidances/checklists/supporting_requirements_3158BF2F.html" guid="_Vael8CGMEdu3VKXZx45D3A">Checklist: Supporting Requirements</a>&nbsp;when speaking to stakeholders to ensure that
    all topics are discussed. Make sure that stakeholders understand the costs of their selections and do not end up
    wanting everything that is on the list.

            <strong>Security:</strong> Will elements of the system or system data need to be secure? State requirements to
            protect access to certain resources or information.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    Usability
</h3>
<p>
    Usability requirements are critical to the success of any system. Unfortunately, usability requirements are often the
    most poorly specified requirements. Consider this common requirement: The system shall be easy to use. This doesn''t
    help much, because it cannot be verified.
</p>
<p>
    While capturing usability requirements, it is a good idea to identify issues and concerns first, and then refine these
    into verifiable requirements later (see <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../../openup/guidances/guidelines/writing_good_requirements_48248536.html" guid="_6jXzYNcKEdqz_d2XWoVt6Q">Guideline: Writing Good Requirements</a>). According to a traditional definition,
    usability consists of five factors:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Ease of learning:</strong> A user with a specified level of experience must be able to learn how to use
            the system in a specified amount of time.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Task efficiency:</strong> A user should be able to complete a specified task in a specified time (or
            number of mouse clicks).
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Ease of remembering:</strong> A user should be able to remember how to accomplish specified tasks after
            not using the system for a specified period of time.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Understandability:</strong> A user must be able to understand system prompts and messages and what the
            system does.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Subjective satisfaction:</strong> A specified percentage of the user community must express
            satisfaction with using the system.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    You may want to use the following method to identify and specify usability requirements:
</p>
<div style="MARGIN-LEFT: 2em">
    <ol>
        <li>
            Identify the key usability issues by looking at critical tasks, user profiles, system goals, and previous
            usability problems.
        </li>
        <li>
            Choose the appropriate style to express the requirements: 
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Performance style:</strong> Specify how fast users can learn various tasks and how fast they
                    can perform the tasks after training.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Defect style:</strong> Rather than measuring task times, identify usability defects and
                    specifies how frequently they may occur.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Guideline style:</strong> Specify the general appearance and response time of the user
                    interface by reference to an accepted and well-defined standard
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Write the actual requirements, including performance criteria (see <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../../openup/guidances/guidelines/writing_good_requirements_48248536.html" guid="_6jXzYNcKEdqz_d2XWoVt6Q">Guideline: Writing Good Requirements</a>&nbsp;for more information).
        </li>
    </ol>
</div>
<h3>
    Reliability
</h3>
<p>
    Reliability includes the system''s ability to continue running under stress and adverse conditions. In the case of an
    application, reliability relates to the amount of time that the software is available and running as opposed to time
    unavailable. Specify reliability acceptance levels, as well as how they will be measured and evaluated. Describe
    reliability criteria in measurable terms. This is usually expressed as the allowable time between failures or the total
    allowable failure rate. Other important reliability considerations include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Accuracy:</strong> Specify requirements for the precision (resolution) and the accuracy (by some known
            standard) that is required in any calculation performed or in system output.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Availability:</strong> Specify requirements for the percentage of time the system is available for use,
            hours of use, maintenance access, and degraded-mode operations. Availability is typically specified in terms of
            the Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF).
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Recoverability:</strong> Specify requirements for recovery from failure. This is typically specified in
            terms of the Mean Time to Repair (MTTR).
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Frequency and severity of failures:</strong> Specify the maximum defect rate (typically expressed as
            defects/KSLOC or defects/function-point) and severity of failures. Severity&nbsp;may be categorized in terms of
            <strong>minor</strong>, <strong>significant</strong>, and <strong>critical</strong> defects. The requirements
            must define each of these terms unambiguously. For example, a <strong>critical</strong> defect could be defined
            as one that results in loss of data or complete inability to use certain functionality of the system.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    Performance
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Response times:</strong> Specify the amount of time available for the system to complete specified
            tasks and transactions (average, maximum). Use units of measurement. <em>Examples:</em>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Any interface between a user and the system shall have a maximum response time of 2 seconds.
            </li>
            <li>
                The product shall download the new status parameters within 5 minutes of a change.<br />
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Throughput:</strong> Specify the capacity of the system to support a given flow of information (for
        example, transactions per second).<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Capacity:</strong> Specify on the volumes that the product must be able to deal with and the numbers of
        data stored by the product. Make sure that the requirement description is quantified, and thus can be tested. Use
        unit of measurement such as: the number of customers or transactions the system can accommodate, resource usage
        (memory, disk, . . . ) or degradation modes (what is the acceptable mode of operation when the system has been
        degraded in some manner) <em>Examples:</em> 
        <ul>
            <li>
                The product shall cater for 300 simultaneous users within the period from 9:00 AM to 11 AM.
            </li>
            <li>
                Maximum loading at other periods will be 150.<br />
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Start-up:</strong> The time for the system to start up.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Shut-down:</strong> The time for the system to shut down.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    Supportability
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Adaptability:</strong> Are there any special requirements regarding adaptation of the software
            (including upgrading)? List requirements for the ease with which the system is adapted to new environments.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Compatibility:</strong> Are there any requirements regarding this system and its compatibility with
            previous versions of this system or legacy systems that provide the same capability?
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Configurability:</strong> Will the product be configured after it has been deployed? In what way will
            the system be configured?
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Installation:</strong> State any special requirements regarding system installation
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Level of Support:</strong> What is the level of support that the product requires? This is often done using
        a Help desk. If there are to be people who provide support for the product, is that support considered part of what
        you are providing to the customer? Are there any requirements for that support? You might also build support into
        the product itself, in which case this is the place to write those requirements. Consider the level of support that
        you anticipate providing and what forms it might take.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Maintainability:</strong> Are there any special requirements regarding system maintenance? What are the
        requirements for the intended release cycle for the product and the form that the release will take? Quantify the
        time necessary to make specified changes to the product. There may also be special requirements for
        maintainability, such as&nbsp;a requirement that&nbsp;the product must be able to be maintained by its end-users or
        developers who are not your development team. This has an effect on the way that the product is developed, and
        there may be additional requirements for documentation or training. Describe the type of maintenance and the amount
        of effort required. <em>Examples:</em><br />
    </li>
    <li style="LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none">
        <ul>
            <li>
                A new weather station must be able to be added to the system overnight.
            </li>
            <li>
                The maintenance releases will be offered to end-users once a year.<br />
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Scalability:</strong> What volumes of users and data will the system support? This specifies the expected
        increases in size that the product must be able to handle As businesses grow (or are expected to grow), the
        software products must increase their capacities to cope with the new volumes. This may be expressed as a profile
        over time.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Testability:</strong> Are there any special requirements regarding the testability of the system?
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    Constraints (+)
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Design constraints:</strong> Are there any design decisions that have been mandated that the product
            must adhered to?
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Third-party components:</strong> Specify any mandated legacy, COTS, or open-source components to be
            used with the system.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Implementation languages:</strong> Specify requirements on the implementation languages to be used
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Platform support:</strong> Specify requirements on the platforms that the system will support
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Resource limits:</strong> Specify requirements on the use of system resources, such as memory and hard
            disk space
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Physical Constraints:</strong> Specify requirements on the shape, size, and weight of the resulting
            hardware to house the system
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    Interface Requirements (+)
</h3>
<p>
    Describe both the user interface and interfaces with external systems.
</p>
<h4>
    User interface
</h4>
<p>
    Describe requirements related to user interfaces that are to be implemented by the software. The intention of this
    section is to state the requirements, but not to describe the user interface itself, because interface design may
    overlap the requirements-gathering process. This is particularly true if you are using prototyping as part of your
    requirements gathering process. As you develop prototypes, it is important to capture the requirements that relate to
    the look and feel of the user interface. In other words, be sure that you understand your client’s intentions for the
    product’s look and feel. Record these as requirements, rather than merely using a prototype for approval.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Look and feel:</strong> A description of the aesthetic appearance and layout of the interface. Your
            client may have given you particular demands, such as style, colors, degree of interaction, and so on. This
            section captures the requirements for the interface, rather than the design for the interface. The motivation
            is to capture the expectations, the constraints, and the client’s demands for the interface before designing
            it. <em>Examples:</em>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The product shall have the same layout as the district maps from the engineering department.
            </li>
            <li>
                The product shall use the company color.<br />
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Layout and navigation requirements:</strong> Specify requirements on major screen areas and how they should
        be grouped together.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Consistency:</strong> Consistency in the user interface enables users to predict what will happen. This
        section states requirements on the use of mechanisms to be employed in the user interface. This applies both within
        the system, and with other systems and can be applied at different levels: navigation controls, screen areas sizes
        and shapes, placements for entering / presenting data, terminology<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>User personalization and customization requirements:</strong> Requirements on content that should
        automatically displayed to users or available based on user attributes. Sometimes users allowed to customize the
        content displayed or to personalize displayed content.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    Interfaces to external systems or devices
</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Software interfaces:</strong> Are there any external systems with which this system must interface? Are
            there any constraints on the nature of the interface between this system and any external system, such as the
            format of data passed between these systems? Do they use any particular protocol? Describe software interfaces
            with other components. These may be purchased components, components reused from another application, or
            components being developed for subsystems outside of the scope of the system under consideration, but with
            which this it must interact. For each system, consider both provided and required interfaces.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Hardware interfaces:</strong> Define any hardware interfaces that are to be supported by the software,
            including logical structure, physical addresses, expected behavior, and so on.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Communications interfaces:</strong> Describe any communications interfaces to other systems or devices,
            such as local area networks (LANs), remote serial devices, and so on.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    Business Rules (+)
</h3>
<p>
    Besides technical requirements, also consider the particular business domain in which the system needs to fit.
</p>
<p>
    Business rules or policies that the system must conform to may constrain system functionality. Business rules are
    referred to by system use cases and can be in the form of decision tables, computation rules, decision trees,
    algorithms, and so forth. Describing the rules in the flows of the use cases usually clutters the use-case
    specifications. Therefore, they are normally captured in separate artifacts or as annexes related to the use-case
    specifications. In many cases, a business rule applies to more then one use case. Shared business rules should be
    stored in a single repository, such as a supporting requirements document.

          <Presentation name="new_guideline,_6jXzYNcKEdqz_d2XWoVt6Q" briefDescription="" id="-AJQLv2ldVv5KN9eUbdQe_g" orderingGuide="" presentationName="" suppressed="false" authors="" changeDate="2007-07-23T03:28:34" changeDescription="" version="1.0.0" externalId="">
            <MainDescription><![CDATA[<p>
    To write a good requirement, you must write it as a complete sentence, with a subject and a predicate. The
    subject&nbsp;is an Actor, a stakeholder, the system under development, or a design entity that is related to the
    requirement. The predicate specifies an action or intended result that is done for, by, with, or to the subject, often
    including conditions and performance criteria.
</p>
<p>
    Thus, you can analyze a requirement from a grammatical point of view. For example:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        <em>The order entry clerk&nbsp;shall be able to complete 10 customer orders in less than two hours.</em>
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
    This requirement has a subject (the order entry clerk, who is an Actor), a specific and measurable end state (10
    customer orders completed), and a performance criterion (in less than two hours).
</p>
<p>
    In stakeholder requirements, use of the verb form "shall be able to" makes it clear that the requirement&nbsp;specifies
    something that the stakeholder must be <strong>able</strong> to do, but is not (necessarily) forced to do. In system
    requirements, the verb form "shall &lt;action&gt;" makes it clear that the system must perform this action under the
    specified conditions.
</p>
<p>
    Numbered and bulleted lists may make writing clearer in some cases, but each list item must be a complete requirement
    in itself to maximize the benefit of any traceability information.
</p>
<p>
    Words such as <strong>all</strong>, <strong>every,</strong> and <strong>some</strong> can lead to ambiguity. Can you be
    certain that you have taken into account <strong>all</strong> cases?&nbsp; What proportion of the whole&nbsp;does
    <strong>some</strong> represent?
</p>
<p>
    The following simple guidelines will help you&nbsp;write better requirements. For consistency, these examples are all
    in the context of an aircraft. <a class="elementlinkwithusertext"
    href="./../../../openup/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.html#TEL06" guid="_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg">[TEL06]</a>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Define one requirement at a time. For example,
    </li>
</ul>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    <blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
        <p>
            <em>The pilot shall be able to control the aircraft''s angle of climb with one hand.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>The pilot shall be able to feel the angle of climb from the climb control.</em>
        </p>
    </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<ul>
    <li>
        Avoid conjunctions (<b>and</b>, <b>or</b>) that make multiple requirements. For example, use:
    </li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
    <blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
        <p>
            <em>The navigator shall be able to view the aircraft''s position relative to the route''s radio beacons.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>The navigator shall be able to view the aircraft''s position as estimated by inertial guidance.</em>
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        instead of:
    </p>
    <blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
        <p>
            <em>The navigator shall be able to view the aircrafts position relative to the route''s radio beacons or as
            estimated by the inertial guidance.</em>
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        The latter form&nbsp;is potentially dangerous because it is not clear whether the "or"&nbsp;indicates that the
        navigator can chose which method to use for navigation or that the developers can decide which to implement.
    </p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
    <li>
        Avoid let-out clauses or words that imply options or exceptions (<b>unless, except, if necessary, but</b>). These
        are dangerous since it is difficult to determine when the requirement applies. It is better to write separate
        requirements addressing each specific condition, or state of the system. For example, use:

    Research and experience shows that requirements errors are very common, accounting for as much as 56% of all errors
    made during development <a class="elementLinkWithUserText"
    href="./../../../openup/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.html#TAV84"
    guid="_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg">[TAV84]</a>.&nbsp; Compounding this problem is the fact that the cost of correcting
    requirements errors increases exponentially throughout the software development lifecycle <a
    class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../openup/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.html#BOE88"
    guid="_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg">[BOE88]</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Frederick Brooks summarized this situation nicely:
</p>
<blockquote>
    The hardest single part of building a software system is deciding what to build. No other part of the conceptual work
    is as difficult as establishing the detailed technical requirements…. No other part of the work so cripples the
    resulting system if done wrong. No other part is as difficult to rectify later.<a class="elementLinkWithUserText"
    href="./../../../openup/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.html#BRO87" guid="_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg">[BRO87]</a>
</blockquote>
<p>
    Therefore, it is critical that you detect requirements errors as early as possible, before they propagate to design,
    implementation, and test artifacts.
</p>
<h1>
    What to avoid when writing requirements
</h1>
<p>
    Although there is sure way to eliminate requirements errors in general, there are common pitfalls in writing
    requirements that are relatively easy to avoid <a
    href="./../../../openup/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.html#TEL06"
    guid="_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg">[TEL06]</a>.
</p>
<h2>
    Ambiguity
</h2>
<p>
    Avoiding ambiguity is one of the most difficult mandates in writing requirements. Try to write as clearly and
    explicitly as possible. Be specific. If you must use vague or ambiguous terms, make sure that you define them in the
    glossary.
</p>
<p>
    Have several colleagues and stakeholders review your requirements to ensure a consistent, common understanding.
    Although there is no definitive test for ambiguity, other than consensus, some dangerous ambiguities can be caused by
    the use of the words <b>for, or</b>, and <strong>unless</strong>.&nbsp;
</p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    <b>Example</b> 
    <p>
        "The same subsystem shall also be able to generate a visible or audible caution/warning signal for the attention of
        the co-pilot or navigator."
    </p>
    <p>
        Which subsystem? Is the signal to be visible, audible, or both? Is this both a caution and a warning, just a
        caution, or just a warning? Is it for both the co-pilot and the navigator or just one of them? If just one of them,
        which one and under what conditions?
    </p>
</blockquote>
<h2>
    Multiple requirements
</h2>
<p>
    Requirements that contain conjunctions (words that join independent clauses together) are dangerous. Problems arise
    when readers try to figure out which part applies, especially if the different clauses seem to conflict or if the
    individual parts apply separately. Multiple requirements also make verification more complex.
</p>
<p>
    Dangerous conjunctions include: <b>and, or, but</b>.
</p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    <b>Example</b> 
    <p>
        "The battery low warning lamp shall light up when the voltage drops below 3.6 Volts, and the current workspace or
        input data shall be saved."
    </p>
    <p>
        Should the battery low-warning lamp light up when the voltage drops and when the workspace is saved? Should the
        battery low warning lamp light up and the workspace be saved when the voltage drops?
    </p>
</blockquote>
<h2>
    Let-out or escape&nbsp;clauses
</h2>
<p>
    Requirements that include options or exceptions are dangerous. They seem to ask for something definite, but at the last
    moment, they back down and allow other options. Problems arise when the requirements are to be tested, and someone has
    to decide what (if anything) could prove that the requirement was met.
</p>
<p>
    Dangerous words that imply exceptions include: <b>if, when, but, except, unless, although</b>.
</p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    <b>Examples</b> 
    <p>
        "The forward passenger doors shall open automatically when the aircraft has halted, except when the rear ramp is
        deployed."
    </p>
    <p>
        "The fire alarm shall always be sounded when smoke is detected, unless the alarm is being tested or the engineer
        has suppressed the alarm."
    </p>
    <p>
        The latter sentence is a truly dangerous requirement!
    </p>
</blockquote>
<h2>
    Rambling
</h2>
<p>
    Long, rambling sentences, especially when combined with arcane language or references to unreachable documents, quickly
    lead to confusion and error.
</p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    <b>Example</b> 
    <p>
        "Provided that the designated input signals from the specified devices are received in the correct order where the
        system is able to differentiate the designators, the output signal shall comply with the required framework of
        section 3.1.5 to indicate the desired input state."
    </p>
</blockquote>
<h2>
    Premature design
</h2>
<p>
    Requirements should specify the design envelope without unnecessary constraints on a specific design. If we supply too
    much detail, we start to design the system. Going too far is tempting for designers, especially when they come to their
    favorite bits.
</p>
<p>
    Danger signs include <b>names of components, materials, software objects</b> or <b>procedures</b>, and <b>database
    fields</b>.
</p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    <b>Example</b> 
    <p>
        "The antenna shall be capable of receiving FM signals, using a copper core with nylon covering and a waterproof
        hardened rubber shield."
    </p>
    <p>
        Specifying design rather than actual need increases the cost of systems by placing needless constraints on
        development and manufacture. Often, knowing <i>why</i> is much better than knowing <i>what</i>.
    </p>
</blockquote>
<h2>
    Mixing different kinds of requirements
</h2>
<p>
    The user requirements form a complete model of what users want. They need to be organized coherently to show gaps and
    overlaps. The same applies to system requirements, which form a complete functional model of the proposed system. A
    quick road to confusion is to mix up requirements for users, systems, and how the system should be designed, tested, or
    installed.
</p>
<p>
    Danger signs are any references to <b>system, design, testing</b>, or <b>installation</b>.
</p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    <b>Example</b> 
    <p>
        "The user shall be able to view the currently selected channel number which shall be displayed in 14pt Swiss type
        on an LCD panel tested to Federal Regulation Standard 567-89 and mounted with shockproof rubber washers."
    </p>
</blockquote>
<h2>
    Speculation
</h2>
<p>
    Requirements are part of a contract between customer and developer. There is no room for wish lists, meaning general
    terms about things that somebody probably wants.
</p>
<p>
    Danger signs include vagueness about <b>which type of user is speaking</b> and generalizations, such as <b>usually,
    generally, often, normally, typically</b>.
</p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    <b>Example</b> 
    <p>
        "Users normally require early indication of intrusion into the system."
    </p>
</blockquote>
<h2>
    Vague, undefined terms
</h2>
<p>
    Many words used informally to indicate system quality are too vague for use in requirements. Vague terms include, among
    others: <b>user-friendly, versatile, flexible, approximately, as possible</b>.
</p>
<p>
    Requirements using these terms are unverifiable, because there is no definitive test to show whether the system has the
    indicated property.
</p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    <b>Examples</b> 
    <p>
        "The print dialog shall be versatile and user-friendly."
    </p>
    <p>
        "The OK status indicator lamp shall be illuminated as soon as possible after the system self-check is completed."
    </p>
</blockquote>
<h2>
    Expressing mere possibilities
</h2>
<p>
    Suggestions that are not explicitly stated as requirements are invariably ignored by developers.
</p>
<p>
    "Possible options" are indicated with terms such as <b>may, might, should, ought, could, perhaps, probably</b>.
</p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    <b>Example</b> 
    <p>
        "The reception subsystem probably ought to be powerful enough to receive a signal inside a steel-framed building."
    </p>
</blockquote>
<h2>
    Wishful thinking
</h2>
<p>
    Wishful thinking means asking for the impossible. Engineering is a real-world activity, and no system or component is
    perfect.
</p>
<p>
    Wishful-thinking terms include <b>reliable, safe, handle all unexpected failures, please all users, run on all
    platforms, never fail, upgradeable to all future situations</b>.
</p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    <b>Examples</b> 
    <p>
        "The gearbox shall be 100% safe in normal operation."
    </p>
    <p>
        "The network shall handle all unexpected errors without crashing."

            <MainDescription><![CDATA[<p>
    Requirement Attributes are properties of a requirement. Attributes capture important additional information about a
    requirement. This information can subsequently be used to answer queries about the status of the development project.
</p>
<h4>
    Examples of attributes
</h4>
<p>
    Below is a list of attributes typically used by small projects, along with a brief description of their meaning. Some
    attributes are best described as a number, whilst other are best described as a date, a Boolean value (true or false),
    or a freeform text field. Other attributes can be expressed as enumerated lists. For instance, Priority may have values
    of High, Medium, or Low.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Priority</strong> - Statement of relative importance of the requirement to stakeholders (high, medium, low).
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Assigned to</strong> - Who in the organization is responsible for making sure the requirement is met (person''s
    name or organizational name).
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Target Iteration</strong> – The iteration in which the requirement is planned to be implemented (number or
    text).
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Estimation of Size</strong> - gives you a high-level estimate for the effort required to implement and verify
    the requirement, typically measured using a neutral unit such as points. (See <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../../openup/guidances/guidelines/agile_estimation_A4EF42B3.html" guid="_CGHskBEdEdqY7JB6N6CW2w">Guideline: Agile Estimation</a>&nbsp;for more information).
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Effort Remaining</strong> – An estimate of the remaining effort to implement and verify the requirement
    (hours).
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Completion Status</strong> – The progress of implementing a requirement. This may be captured as an enumerated
    list (Complete, Partially Completed, Not Started) or can be inferred from the Effort Remaining attribute.
</p>
<p>
    When these attributes are assigned values for each requirement, it becomes easy to answer typical queries about the
    project such as:
</p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    <p>
        <em>How many requirements are to be implemented in the current iteration?<br />
        </em> (Query the <strong>Target Iteration</strong> attribute)
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>What percentage of the high priority requirements&nbsp;is currently implemented?<br />
        </em> (Query the <strong>Completion Status</strong> and <strong>Priority</strong> attributes)
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>How many requirements assigned to the current iteration remain unimplemented?<br />
        </em> (Query the <strong>Target Iteration</strong> and <strong>Completion Status</strong> attributes)
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Which requirements are assigned to me?<br />
        </em> (Query the <strong>Assigned To</strong> attribute)<br />
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
    Examples of other useful requirements attributes include:
</p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    <p>
        <strong>Source</strong> - Person, document or other origin of a given requirement. This is useful for determining
        whom to call for questions or for grouping requirements according to the person making the demands.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Comments</strong> - Reviewer''s or writer''s comments on a requirement.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Difficulty</strong> - An indication of the level of effort needed or how hard it will be to implement the
        requirement (high, medium, low).
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Risk</strong> - Confidence measure on the likelihood of meeting (or not meeting) a requirement. Could be
        high, medium, low or the integers one through ten.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Test ID</strong> - Identification of a specific test or other method of verification.
    </p>

            <MainDescription><![CDATA[<h3>
    Use Case Formats
</h3>
<p>
    The level of detail required in use cases differs from project to project, and even between use cases and scenarios
    within the same project.&nbsp; A use case format that works in one situation may be totally unsuited for
    another.&nbsp;The key to maximizing efficiency and effectiveness is to capture the right amount of detail for each
    particular use case and scenario.&nbsp;(See <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../openup/guidances/supportingmaterials/references_6CCF393.html#ADO04" guid="_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg">[ADO04]</a> for more information on use case formats.)
</p>
<p>
    Some use cases need a high degree of detail. If the writers used a template, then they filled out all or almost all of
    its fields for each use case. High-detail use cases are best suited complex, novel, or safety-critical functionality,
    such as that found in flight control systems, telephone switches, and so forth where the risk of misinterpretation is
    high.
</p>
<p>
    Other use cases need less detail. If the writers used a template, then they may have left many of the fields blank.
    Low-detail use cases are best suited for well understood, low complexity or less safety-critical functionality where
    most of the stakeholders have a strong background in the problem domain and the risk of misinterpretation is low. In
    these cases, simple brief descriptions or step-by-step outlines suffice.
</p>
<p>
    Furthermore, not all scenarios are created equally.&nbsp; Within the same use case, some scenarios are very well
    understood and a brief description is sufficient to ensure un-ambiguous interpretation.&nbsp;&nbsp; Other scenarios may
    require more detail to capture the essential behavior un-ambiguously.
</p>
<p>
    Finally, as explained in <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../../openup/guidances/guidelines/detail_ucs_and_scenarios_6BC56BB7.html" guid="_4BJ_YCxSEdqjsdw1QLH_6Q">Guideline: Detail Use Cases and Scenarios</a>, it makes sense to write use cases
    iteratively. Starting with the basic details, you can then identify the various alternative and error paths that the
    use case might follow so that you can evaluate, rearrange, or eliminate them, and then elaborate or fill in the details
    of the&nbsp;remaining scenarios.
</p>
<p>
    Write use cases and scenarios in one or more of the following formats, progressively, until you reach the level of
    detail required:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Use-case model overview:</strong> A format for understanding the “big-picture”
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Use-case brief descriptions:</strong> A format for writing summary use cases
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Step-by-step outlines:</strong> A format for writing less formal, low-ceremony use cases
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Fully detailed:</strong> A format for writing more formal, high-ceremony use cases
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    Use-Case Model Overview
</h4>
<p>
    Create a use-case model overview, which captures actors and associated use cases.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Start by identifying the list of actors who will use the system, and then identify at least one goal for each.
        Actors without goals indicate that you haven’t adequately defined the system. The actor is beyond the system’s
        scope, doesn’t belong in the system, or is part of another actor.
    </li>
    <li>
        Likewise, leftover goals can indicate that the system is too complex and you''re trying to accomplish too much, or
        that you haven’t adequately defined all of the necessary actors. Carefully evaluate the leftovers to see if you are
        just overlooking some detail, or whether they don’t belong in the system.
    </li>
    <li>
        Remove unassociated actors and goals from the model.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Sometimes, this overview may provide enough information to serve as the use-case model for very small,
    high-communicating, low-ceremony project teams. Usually, the use-case model overview is the first step of identifying
    use cases and system boundaries.
</p>
<h4>
    Use-Case brief descriptions
</h4>
<p>
    Write two to four sentences per use case, capturing key activities and key-extension handling.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Expand the high priority use-cases by writing a two- to four-sentence use cases for each entry in the list.
    </li>
    <li>
        Briefly describe each use case’s main&nbsp;scenario and most important extensions.
    </li>
    <li>
        Include enough information to eliminate ambiguity for at least the main&nbsp;scenario.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    Step-by-step outlines&nbsp;
</h4>
<p>
    Write the step-by-step outline which describes the interaction between the actor(s) and the system.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Key scenarios are detailed to describe the interaction
    </li>
    <li>
        Triggering events are specified
    </li>
    <li>
        Information exchanged&nbsp;is described
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    Fully Detailed
</h4>
<p>
    Complete all sections of the <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../openup/guidances/templates/uc_specification_E97E98B0.html" guid="_0cpNwMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">Use-Case Specification</a>&nbsp;template.

    <li>
        Special requirements are complete and un-ambiguous
    </li>
    <li>
        Pre- and Post-conditions are specified.

            <MainDescription><![CDATA[<h1>
    Introduction
</h1>
<p>
    This example illustrates how the use-case model and associated use-case specification will evolve during the lifecycle.
    It shows the state of the use case model at two points in the lifecycle: early inception and towards the end of
    elaboration. The purpose is to illustrate how one would <a class="elementLink"
    href="./../../../openup/tasks/find_and_outline_requirements-2.html" guid="_P9cMUPV_EdmdHa9MmVPgqQ">Find and Outline
    Requirements</a> and <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../openup/tasks/detail_requirements-2.html"
    guid="_0e1mIMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">Detail Requirements</a> so as to maximize stakeholder value and minimize risk early in
    the project, as well as to minimize re-work later.
</p>
<p>
    The example uses an Automated Teller Machine as the example system, because it is familiar to most people. This
    familiarity simplifies understanding the principles without getting lost in domain specific terminology.
</p>
<h2>
    Early inception
</h2>
<p>
    Assume you have just started on the project as the Analyst. You have identified the key stakeholders and met with them
    to discuss their needs. During your meetings, you identified a number of key actors, use cases, and supporting
    requirements for the ATM system. You captured the use cases and actors, with names and brief descriptions only, in the
    use-case model. An example of this work is given in the document <strong>ATM UC Model Inception</strong>.
</p>
<p>
    Prior to committing significant time to detailing these use cases now, you recognize that a “breadth before depth”
    approach can save you valuable time and permit you to identify the highest value and highest risk items so that you can
    concentrate on those first.
</p>
<p>
    You hold a brainstorming session with the stakeholders and outline the basic flow of each of the main use cases. As you
    are working through, you may identify some additional alternative flows. Fight the urge to “dive-in” to the details on
    these alternative flows at this point, simply list them and come back later when you have a better understanding of the
    “big picture”.
</p>
<p>
    Examples of the notes you took during this exercise are attached (<strong>Withdraw Cash Outline</strong>,
    <strong>Deposit Funds Outline</strong> and <strong>Transfer</strong> <strong>Funds Outline</strong>).<br />
    <b>Note:</b> the choice of font is intentional to illustrate that these are notes, not formal documents.
</p>
<p>
    Reviewing your notes, you recognize that there is some behavior that is common to most of the use cases, namely the
    steps required to validate the Bank Customer. Factoring this behavior out into an &lt;&lt;included&gt;&gt; use case
    will simplify communications, iteration planning, and maintenance.
</p>
<p>
    You update the use case model accordingly: <strong>ATM UC Model Elaboration</strong>.
</p>
<h2>
    Elaboration
</h2>
<p>
    With a better understanding of the system, you can now prioritize your effort to maximize value and minimize risk. You
    start by detailing the common behavior captured in the use case: Validate User. This use case captures key
    architectural requirements that will exercise a significant portion of the system (communications with the Bank, card
    reader interface, and so on). Implementing this one key scenario will go a long way to reducing risk.
</p>
<p>
    An example of the Validate User use-case specification is attached: <strong>Use Case Spec - Validate User.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Note that there may still be some un-answered questions, but that’s OK. Capture these directly in the use-case
    specification and get them answered (see Section 5.6 of the <strong>Validate User UC Specification</strong>, for an
    example).
</p>
<p>
    Continuing with another architecturally significant thread, you detail the basic flow and some key alternative flows of
    the use case: Withdraw Cash. You know that if the team can implement this, much of the other functionality will be low
    risk.
</p>
<p>
    An example of the Withdraw Cash use-case specification is attached:&nbsp;<strong>Use Case Spec - Withdraw
    Cash</strong>.
</p>
<h1>
    Summary
</h1>
<p>
    By following a breadth before depth approach to outlining and detailing use cases, you can make better decisions on
    priorities. Start by identifying actors. Then for each actor, ask “What is the main purpose this actor would like to
    use the system?”. This will lead to the identification of the use cases. Capture the actors and use cases in the
    use-case model along with a brief description.
</p>
<p>
    Prioritize the use cases, and then draft the main scenario or basic flow. As you are working through this you may
    identify alternate flows (what can go wrong, what options are available, and so on). Capture these, along with a brief
    description.
</p>
<p>
    Review the use-case model and reprioritize and assess risk. For the high priority (based on value to the stakeholders)
    or high risk use cases,&nbsp;detail the main scenario and the critical alternate flows.
</p>
<p>
    If you follow this approach, you will increase the likelihood of delivering value early, minimizing risk, and
    minimizing re-work.<br />

            <MainDescription><![CDATA[<h3>
    Introduction
</h3>
<p>
    There''s much more to testing software-oriented solutions than simply evaluating functions, interfaces, and
    response-time characteristics. Additional tests should focus on other requirements attributes, such as:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        integrity (resistance to failure)
    </li>
    <li>
        ability to be installed and executed on different platforms
    </li>
    <li>
        ability to handle many requests simultaneously
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    To achieve this, testers develop different types of tests.&nbsp;Each test type has a specific objective and support
    technique.&nbsp;Each technique focuses on testing one or more characteristics or attributes of the solution.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Team members apply these types of tests at different scopes.</em> While <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../openup/roles/tester_9859B590.html" guid="_0ZM4MclgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">Testers</a> are concerned with the
    end-to-end solution,&nbsp;<a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../openup/roles/developer_C633AB7.html" guid="_0YDosMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">Developers</a> are usually focused on a specific unit or component of the <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../openup/workproducts/implementation_917CA61E.html" guid="_0YoQcMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">Implementation</a>.
</p>
<h3>
    Quality Dimension: Functionality
</h3>
<p>
    <strong>Function test:</strong> Tests focused on validating the solution functions as intended, providing the required
    services, methods, or use cases. This test is implemented and executed against different targets-of-test, including
    units, integrated units, applications, and systems.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Security test:</strong> Tests focused on ensuring the target-of-test data (or systems) are accessible only to
    those actors for which they are intended. This test is implemented and executed on various targets-of-test.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Volume test:</strong> Tests focused on verifying the target-of-test''s ability to handle large amounts of data,
    either as input, output, or persistent. Volume testing includes test strategies such as creating queries that would
    return the entire contents of a database, or that would have so many restrictions that no data is returned, or where
    the data entry has the maximum amount of data for each field.
</p>
<h3>
    Quality Dimension:&nbsp;Usability
</h3>
<p>
    <strong>Integrity test:</strong> Tests that focus on assessing the target-of-test''s robustness (resistance to failure),
    and technical compliance to language, syntax, and resource usage. This test is implemented and executed against
    different targets, typically implementation units and components.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Structure test</strong>: Tests that focus on assessing the target-of-test''s adherence to its design and
    formation. For example, with web applications, theses tests might ensure that all links are connected, appropriate
    content is displayed, and no content is orphaned.
</p>
<h3>
    Quality Dimension: Reliability
</h3>
<p>
    <strong>Stress test:</strong> A type of reliability test that focuses on evaluating how the system responds under
    abnormal conditions. Stresses on the system could include extreme workloads, insufficient memory, unavailable services
    and hardware, or limited shared resources. These tests are often performed to gain a better understanding of how and in
    what areas the system will break, so that contingency plans and upgrade maintenance can be planned and budgeted for
    well in advance.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Benchmark test:</strong> A type of performance test that compares the performance of a new or unknown
    target-of-test to a known reference-workload.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Contention test:</strong> Tests focused on validating the target-of-test''s ability to acceptably handle
    multiple actor demands on the same resource (data records, memory, and so on).
</p>
<h3>
    Quality Dimension: Performance
</h3>
<p>
    <strong>Load test:</strong> A type of performance test used to assess the operational limits of a system under varying
    workloads while the system-under-test remains constant. In some variants, the workload remains constant and the
    configuration of the system-under-test is varied. Measurements are usually taken based on the workload throughout and
    transaction response time. The variations in workload usually include emulation of average and peak workloads that
    occur within normal operational tolerances.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Performance profiling:</strong> A test in which the target-of-test''s timing profile is monitored, including
    execution flow, data access, function and system calls to identify and address both performance bottlenecks and
    inefficient processes.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Configuration test:</strong> Tests focused on ensuring the target-of-test functions as intended on different
    hardware and software configurations. This test might also be implemented as a system performance test.
</p>
<h3>
    Quality Dimension: Supportability
</h3>
<p>
    <strong>Installation test:</strong> Tests focused on ensuring the target-of-test installs as intended on different
    hardware and software configurations, and under different conditions (such as insufficient disk space or power
    interruptions). This test is implemented and executed against applications and systems.

</p>
<p align="center">
    Visual modeling raises the level of abstraction
</p>
<p>
    Visual modeling is the use of semantically rich, graphical and textual design notations to capture software designs. A
    notation, such as UML, allows the level of abstraction to be raised, while maintaining rigorous syntax and semantics.
    In this way, it improves communication in the team as the design is formed and reviewed, allowing the reader to reason
    about the design, and it provides an unambiguous basis for implementation.
</p>
<h3>
    How visual models help
</h3>
<p>
    A model is a simplified view of a system. It shows the essentials of the system from a particular perspective and hides
    the nonessential details. Visual models help you:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Increase understanding of complex systems
    </li>
    <li>
        Explore and compare design alternatives at a low cost
    </li>
    <li>
        Form a foundation for implementation
    </li>
    <li>
        Capture requirements precisely
    </li>
    <li>
        Communicate decisions unambiguously
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    Increase understanding of complex systems
</h4>
<p>
    The importance of models increases as systems become more complex. For example, you can build a doghouse without
    blueprints. However, as you progress to building houses and then to skyscrapers, your need for blueprints becomes
    pronounced.
</p>
<p>
    Similarly, a small application built by one person in a few days may be easily understood in its entirety. However, an
    e-commerce system with tens of thousands of source lines of code (SLOCs) or an air traffic control system with hundreds
    of thousands of SLOCs can no longer be easily understood by one person. Constructing models allows a developer to focus
    on the big picture, understand how components interact, and identify fatal flaws.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    Among the various types of models are these examples:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Use cases to specify behavior unambiguously
    </li>
    <li>
        Class diagrams and data model diagrams to capture design
    </li>
    <li>
        State transition diagrams to model dynamic behavior
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Modeling is important because it helps the team visualize, construct, and document the structure and behavior of the
    system without getting lost in complexity.
</p>
<h4>
    Explore and compare design alternatives at a low cost
</h4>
<p>
    You can create and modify simple models inexpensively to explore design alternatives. Innovative ideas can be captured
    and reviewed by other developers before investing in costly code development. When coupled with iterative development,
    visual modeling helps developers assess design changes and communicate these changes to the entire development team.
</p>
<h4>
    Form a foundation for implementation
</h4>
<p>
    Today, many projects employ object-oriented programming languages to build reusable, change-tolerant, and stable
    systems. To get these benefits, it is even more important to use object technology in design.
</p>
<p>
    The creation of visual models, whether on paper; around a whiteboard; or in a modeling tool, can help a team to gain
    agreement on key aspects of the system before investing time in proving their ideas with code. Having a shared model of
    the system promotes collaboration within the team, encouraging everyone to work towards the same goal.
</p>
<p>
    With the support of appropriate tools, you can use a design model to generate an initial code for implementation. This
    is referred to as <strong>forward engineering</strong> or <strong>code generation</strong>. You can also enhance design
    models to include enough information to build the system.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Reverse engineering</strong> may also be applied to generate design models from existing implementations. You
    can use this method to evaluate existing implementations.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Round-trip engineering</strong> combines both forward and reverse engineering techniques to ensure consistent
    design and code. Combined with an iterative process and the right tools, round-trip engineering allows you to
    synchronize the design and code during each iteration.
</p>
<h4>
    Capture requirements precisely
</h4>
<p>
    Before building a system, it''s critical to capture the requirements. Specifying the requirements using a precise and
    unambiguous model helps to ensure that all stakeholders can understand and agree on the requirements.
</p>
<p>
    A model that separates the external behavior of the system from the implementation of it helps you focus on the
    intended use of the system, without getting bogged down in implementation details.
</p>
<h4>
    Communicate decisions unambiguously
</h4>
<p>
    The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is&nbsp;a consistent notation that can be applied for system engineering, as well
    as for business engineering. According to these excerpts from the UML specification, a standard notation:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            Serves as a language for communicating decisions that are not obvious or cannot be inferred from the code
            itself.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Provides semantics that are rich enough to capture all important strategic and tactical decisions.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>

    The Unified Modeling Language [<a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../openup/guidances/supportingmaterials/references_6CCF393.html" guid="_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg">UML05</a>] defines <em>component</em> as follows:
</p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            A modular part of a system that encapsulates its contents and whose manifestation is replaceable within its
            environment. A component defines its behavior in terms of provided and required interfaces. As such, a
            component serves as a type, whose conformance is defined by these provided and required interfaces
            (encompassing both their static as well as dynamic semantics). (See <strong>UML representation</strong> at the
            end of this section for definitions from earlier versions of UML.)
        </p>
        <p>
            A <em>component</em> is defined as a subtype of structured class. Therefore, a component has attributes and
            operations, is able to participate in associations and generalizations, and has internal structure and ports.
        </p>
    </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">
    A number of UML standard stereotypes exist that apply to components, including &lt;&lt;subsystem&gt;&gt; to model
    large-scale components, and &lt;&lt;specification&gt;&gt; and &lt;&lt;realization&gt;&gt; to model components with
    distinct specification and realization definitions, where one specification may have multiple realizations.
</p>
<p align="left">
    Here, we use&nbsp;the term <em>component&nbsp;</em>in a&nbsp;broader way than the UML definition. Rather than defining
    components as having characteristics, such as modularity, deployability, and replaceability, we instead recommend these
    as desirable characteristics of components. See the section on Component Replaceability.
</p>
<h4 align="left">
    Modeling of components
</h4>
<p align="left">
    The UML component is a modeling construct that provides the following capabilities:
</p>
<div align="left">
    <ul>
        <li>
            Group classes to define a larger granularity part of a system
        </li>
        <li>
            Separate the visible interfaces from internal implementation
        </li>
        <li>
            Execute instances run-time
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>
<p align="left">
    A component includes <strong>provided</strong> and <strong>required</strong> interfaces that form the basis for wiring
    components together. A <strong>provided interface</strong> is one that is either implemented directly by the component
    or one of its realizing classes or subcomponents, or it is the type of a provided port of the component. A
    <strong>required interface</strong> is designated by a usage dependency of the component or one of its realizing
    classes or subcomponents, or it is the type of a required port.
</p>
<p align="left">
    A component has an external view (or <em>black box</em> view) through its publicly visible properties and operations
    .Optionally, a behavior such as a protocol state machine may be attached to an interface, a port, and the component
    itself to define the external view more precisely by making dynamic constraints in the sequence of operation calls
    explicit. The wiring between components in a system or other context can be structurally defined by using dependencies
    between component interfaces (typically on component diagrams).
</p>
<p align="left">
    Optionally, you can make a more detailed specification of the structural collaboration by using parts and connectors in
    composite structures to specify the role or instance-level collaboration between components. That is the component''s
    internal view (or <em>white-box</em> view) through its private properties and realizing classes or subcomponents. This
    view shows how the external behavior is realized internally. The mapping between external and internal views is by
    dependencies on components diagrams or delegation connectors to internal parts on composite structure diagrams.
</p>
<p align="left">
    The recommendation is to&nbsp;use components as the representation for design subsystems.
</p>
<h4 align="left">
    UML representation
</h4>
<p align="left">
    The definition of <em>component</em> with the UML has changed over time with the release of different versions. The
    version of UML you use may be constrained by the capabilities of the modeling tools you use. That is why the
    definitions from 1.3 to 2.0 are provided here.
</p>
<p align="left">
    UML 2.0 defined <em>component</em> as the following:
</p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    <blockquote>
        <p align="left">
            ...a modular part of a system that encapsulates its contents and whose manifestation is replaceable within its
            environment.
        </p>
        <p align="left">
            A component defines its behavior in terms of provided and required interfaces. As such, a component serves as a
            type whose conformance is defined by these provided and required interfaces (encompassing both their static as
            well as dynamic semantics).
        </p>
    </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">
    UML 1.5 defined <em>component</em> as the following:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <div align="left">
            A modular, deployable, and replaceable part of a system that encapsulates implementation and exposes a set of
            interfaces. A component is typically specified by one or more classes or subcomponents that reside on it and
            may be implemented by one or more artifacts (e.g., binary, executable, or script files).
        </div>
        <div align="left">
            <p>
                In UML 1.3 and earlier versions of the UML, the component notation was used to represent files in the
                implementation. Files are no longer considered components by the latest UML definitions. However, many
                tools and UML profiles still use the component notation to represent files.

              <MainDescription><![CDATA[<h4>
    Model key perspectives
</h4>
<p>
    Modeling helps raise the level of abstraction because you simplify complex ideas and represent them visually, as
    illustrations. Good models can convey information that helps the team visualize, specify, construct, and document
    software. The Unified Modeling Language (UML) provides an industry-standard approach to software modeling.
</p>
<p>
    When applying this strategy, you can use various techniques:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Identify the key perspectives:</strong> Focus on modeling the things that count. Few (if any) projects
        benefit from modeling the entire design to a great level of detail. Make sure that you understand why you are
        modeling something and who will benefit.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Communicate key architectural perspectives:</strong> Even if you choose to model very little&nbsp;of your
        design, it is often advantageous to produce diagrams that communicate the key architectural aspects of the system.
        Conveying the "big picture" to the rest of the team helps them understand the overall approach and develop cohesive
        software.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Sketch the design:</strong> Not all models need to be detailed completely and presented in a software
        modeling tool. It is often perfectly acceptable (if not desirable) to produce hand-drawn sketches on paper or on a
        whiteboard when you are exploring and communicating the architecture and design with your team. You can use a
        digital camera or an electronic whiteboard to capture these diagrams and share them. For many small projects, this
        is often all you need. See <a href="http://www.agilemodeling.com/">http://www.agilemodeling.com/</a> for more
        information.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Use a modeling tool as needed</strong>:&nbsp;If the team members are changing models throughout the
        project, sharing patterns/structure, debugging design, describing behavior, etc., then static photos or paper will
        become difficult to work with. The team may want to capture design in a software modeling tool. Other than
        communicating the design to the team, another benefit of a such a tool is the&nbsp;generation of structural code
        from the models. Many software development tools allow you to view the code as models, making it easier to
        comprehend static and dynamic aspects of a complex code base.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Agree on a standard notation:</strong> In a team environment, it is important that others can understand
        your diagrams without much explanation. Choosing a standard notation enables others to quickly comprehend your
        diagrams without ambiguity. The Unified Modeling Language is an example of a widely understood notation.
    </li>

            <MainDescription><![CDATA[<h4>
    Origins
</h4>
<p>
    The idea of patterns as it is now applied to software design comes from the work of Christopher Alexander. He has
    written widely on the subject of applying patterns to the design and construction of towns and buildings. Two of his
    books, <em>A Pattern Language</em> [<a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../openup/guidances/supportingmaterials/references_6CCF393.html#ALE77" guid="_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg">ALE77</a>] and <em>The Timeless Way of Building</em> [<a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../openup/guidances/supportingmaterials/references_6CCF393.html#ALE79" guid="_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg">ALE79</a>] have had the greatest impact on the software community and the adoption of
    software patterns for the design of software. His concepts of patterns and pattern language provide a model for the
    capture of software design expertise in a form that can then be reapplied in recurring situations.
</p>
<h4>
    A definition of patterns
</h4>
<p>
    Today, the most commonly used definition of software patterns is from [<a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../openup/guidances/supportingmaterials/references_6CCF393.html#GAM95" guid="_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg">GAM95</a>]:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        "A design pattern describes the problem, a solution to the problem consisting of a general arrangement of objects
        and classes, when to apply the solution, and the consequences of applying the solution."
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
    This definition often serves only as a starting point, however. A richer definition, based on Alexander’s work, is
    offered by Gabriel in his book, <em>A Timeless Way of Hacking</em> [<a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../openup/guidances/supportingmaterials/references_6CCF393.html#ALU03" guid="_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg">ALU03</a>], in which each pattern is a three-part rule that expresses relationships
    among a certain context, a certain system of forces that occur repeatedly in that context, and a certain software
    configuration that allows these forces to resolve themselves.
</p>
<h4>
    Describing patterns
</h4>
<p>
    It is commonplace to describe patterns&nbsp;using the&nbsp;format made popular by Erich Gamma and his three colleagues
    [<a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../openup/guidances/supportingmaterials/references_6CCF393.html#GAM95" guid="_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg">GAM95</a>]. They have come to be known as the Gang of Four (GoF); therefore, their
    description is known as the <strong>GoF format</strong>. The GoF format uses the following keywords to describe
    object-oriented design patterns:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Pattern name and classification:</strong> Naming the pattern allows design to work at a higher level of
            abstraction, using a vocabulary of patterns. Gamma says that finding a good name is one of the hardest problems
            of developing a catalogue of patterns (see <strong>Pattern catalogues</strong> later in this section).
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Intent:</strong> An answer to questions such as: What does the pattern do? What problem does it
            address?
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Also known as:</strong> Other names for the pattern.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Motivation:</strong> A concrete scenario that illustrates a design problem and how the pattern solves
            the problem.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Applicability:</strong> Instructions for how you can recognize situations in which patterns are
            applicable.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Structure:</strong> A graphical representation of the classes in the pattern.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Participants:</strong> The responsibilities of the classes and objects that participate in the pattern.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Collaborations:</strong> How participants collaborate to fulfil their responsibilities.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Consequences:</strong> The results, side effects and trade offs caused by using the pattern.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Implementation:</strong> Guidance on the implementation of the pattern.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Sample code:</strong> Code fragments that illustrate the pattern’s implementation.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Known uses:</strong> Where to find real-world examples of the pattern.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Related patterns:</strong> Synergies, differences, and other pattern relationships.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Although the GoF format is specifically intended for object-oriented development, you can use it, with slight
    modification, to address other software patterns. A more general keyword format for software patterns based on
    Alexander’s principles uses keywords such as <em>problem</em>, <em>context</em>, <em>forces</em> and <em>solution</em>.
</p>
<h4>
    Pattern catalogs
</h4>
<p>
    To assist with the identification and selection of patterns, various classification schemes have been proposed. One of
    the early schemes, proposed by Buschmann and his associates, [<a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../openup/guidances/supportingmaterials/references_6CCF393.html#BUS96" guid="_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg">BUS96</a>] uses three classifiers: granularity, functionality, and structured
    principles. Of those three classifiers, it is their granularity classifier that has remained popular. Granularity
    classifies patterns into three levels of abstraction:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Architectural patterns:</strong> Architectural patterns express the fundamental structure of a software
            scheme. Examples of architectural pattern include: layers, pipes and filters, and the model view controller
            pattern.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Design patterns:</strong> Software architecture usually consists of smaller architectural units that
            are described by design patterns. The GoF pattern is an example of a design pattern.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Idioms.</strong> An idiom is the lowest-level pattern, and it is specific to a programming language.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Buschmann and his colleagues introduced four groups for categorizing architectural patterns:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Structure
    </li>
    <li>
        Distributed systems
    </li>
    <li>
        Interactive systems
    </li>
    <li>
        Adaptable systems
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The following table shows the categorization of their architectural patterns.

    For design patterns, Gamma''s group categorized their design patterns by purpose, using three categories:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Creational
    </li>
    <li>
        Structural
    </li>
    <li>
        Behavioral
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    Pattern languages
</h4>
<p>
    In addition to the concept of patterns, Alexander also gave the software community the concept of a pattern language.
    The purpose of developing a pattern language was to provide a vocabulary of design principles (patterns) that would
    allow those who work, study, or live in buildings to communicate effectively with the planners and designers of those
    buildings. Alexander explains that when using a pattern language:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        We always use it as a sequence, going through the patterns, moving always from the larger patterns to the smaller,
        always from the ones that create structure to the ones which then embellish those structures, and then to those
        that embellish the embellishments.
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
    In applying patterns in this way, Alexander advocated the use of generative pattern languages, ones that, given an
    initial context, would always lead to good design.&nbsp; Alexander&nbsp;states:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        Thus, as in the case of natural languages, the pattern language is generative. It not only tells us the rules of
        arrangement, but shows us how to construct arrangements — as many as we want — which satisfies the rules.
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
    In the application of software patterns, pattern names provide a vocabulary for the communication of software ideas.
    The sequential application of patterns finds application in software design processes, both waterfall and iterative,
    that successively apply architectural patterns, and then design patterns, and, finally, idioms to design and implement
    a software system. Software processes, however, rely on the skills of the Architect and Developer roles to guide the
    application of patterns, rather than a generative pattern language.

            <MainDescription><![CDATA[<p align="left">
    The software industry and literature use the term <strong>componen</strong>t to refer to many different things. It is
    often used in the broad sense to mean a constituent part. It is also frequently used in a narrow sense to denote
    specific characteristics that enable replacement and assembly in larger systems.
</p>
<p align="left">
    Here. we use <em>component</em> to mean <strong>an encapsulated part of a system</strong> that is nontrivial, nearly
    independent, and replaceable and that fulfils a clear function in the context of well-defined architecture. This
    includes two types of components:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <div align="left">
            <p>
                <strong>Design component.</strong> A significant encapsulated part of the design that includes design
                subsystems and, sometimes, significant design classes and design packages.
            </p>
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div align="left">
            <p>
                <strong>Implementation component.</strong> A significant encapsulated part of the implementation, generally
                code that implements a design component.
            </p>
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>
<p align="left">
    Ideally, the design reflects the implementation; therefore, you can simply refer to <em>components</em>, with each
    component having a design and an implementation.
</p>
<h4 align="left">
    Component replaceability
</h4>
<p align="left">
    In UML terminology, components should be replaceable. However, this may mean only that the component exposes a set of
    interfaces that hide an underlying implementation.
</p>
<p align="left">
    There are other, stronger, kinds of replaceability: .
</p>
<div align="left">
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                <strong>Source file replaceability:</strong> If two classes are implemented in a single source code file,
                then those classes cannot usually be separately versioned and controlled. However, if a set of files fully
                implements a single component (and no other component), then the component source files are replaceable.
                This characteristic makes it easier to use version control, to use the file as a baseline, and to reuse the
                source file.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <strong>Deployment replaceability:</strong> If two classes are deployed in a single executable file, then
                each class is not independently replaceable in a deployed system. It is desirable for larger-granularity
                components to be replaceable during deployment, which allows new versions of the component to be deployed
                without having to rebuild the other components. This usually means that there is one file or one set of
                files that deploy the component, and no other component.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <strong>Run-time replaceability:</strong> If a component can be redeployed into a running system, then it
                is referred to as <em>run-time replaceable</em>. This enables you to upgrade software without loss of
                availability.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <strong>Location transparency:</strong> Components with network-addressable interfaces are referred to as
                having <em>location transparency</em>. This allows components to be relocated to other servers or to be
                replicated on multiple servers to support fault tolerance, load balancing, and so on. These kinds of
                components are often referred to as <em>distributed</em> or <em>distributable</em> components.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>
<h4 align="left">
    Component instantiation
</h4>
<p align="left">
    A component may or may not be directly instantiated at run time.
</p>
<p align="left">
    An indirectly instantiated component is implemented, or realized, by a set of classes, subcomponents, or parts. The
    component itself does not appear in the implementation; it merely serves as a design that an implementation must
    follow. The set of realizing classes, subcomponents, or parts must cover the entire set of operations specified in the
    provided interface of the component. The manner of implementing the component is the responsibility of the implementer.
</p>
<p align="left">
    A directly instantiated component specifies its own encapsulated implementation. It is instantiated as an addressable
    object, which means that a design component has a corresponding construct in the implementation language; therefore, it
    can be referenced explicitly.

    The architect should perform this task&nbsp;through collaboration with the whole&nbsp;team to promote consensus and a

    common understanding of the overall solution. The architect should be working to coordinate and guide the technical

    activities of the team, rather than seeking to do all the work alone.&nbsp;The architect should place emphasis&nbsp;on

    involving&nbsp;the developer(s) throughout this task.

            <MainDescription><![CDATA[<p>
    This artifact gives context and guidance for developers to construct the system. It''s a critical artifact used to help
    capture and make architectural decisions, and explain those decisions to developers. It can contain any information and
    references that are appropriate in communicating how developers should build the system. It generally doesn''t contain
    design information, although it will likely reference architecturally significant design elements.
</p>
<p>
    At a minimum, this artifact should:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        List guidance, decisions, and constraints the developers must follow in building the system
    </li>
    <li>
        Justify those guidelines, decisions and constraints
    </li>
    <li>
        Describe the <a class="elementLink" href="./../../openup/guidances/concepts/arch_mech_2932DFB6.html" guid="_mzxI0A4LEduibvKwrGxWxA">Architectural Mechanism</a>s and where they should be applied.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Team members who were not involved in those archtiectural decisions need to understand the reasoning behind
    the&nbsp;context of the architecture so they can best address the needs of the system.
</p>
<p>
    Other recommended content is:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        References to architecturally significant requirements
    </li>
    <li>
        References to architecturally significant design elements
    </li>
    <li>
        Packaging instructions for subsystems and components
    </li>
    <li>
        Layers and critical subsystems
    </li>
    <li>
        Critical system interfaces
    </li>
    <li>
        Key abstractions
    </li>
    <li>
        Important analysis classes
    </li>
    <li>
        Key scenarios that describe critical behavior of the system
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Architects should use this artifact to collaborate with other team members in developing the architecture, and to help
    team members understand the motivations behind architectural decisions so those decisions can be robustly implemented.
    For example, the architect may place constraints on how data is packaged and communicated between different parts of
    the system. This may appear to be a burden, but the justification in the Architecture Notebook can explain that there
    is a significant performance bottleneck when communicating with a legacy system. The rest of the system must adapt to
    this bottleneck by following a specific data packaging scheme.
</p>
<p>
    This artifact should also inform the Project Manager and other team members how the system is partitioned or organized
    so the team can adapt itself to the needs of the system. It also gives whoever must maintain and change the
    architecture later their first glimpse of the system and its technical motivations.
</p>
<p>
    This artifact is distinct from the <a class="elementLink" href="./../../openup/guidances/concepts/executable_architecture_D4E68CBD.html" guid="_O1kAANvfEduv2KOT-Teh6w">Executable Architecture</a>. This artifact describes how the system should be
    constructed, while the Executable Architecture is a build that contains part of the validated architecture.

            <RepresentationOptions>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The architecture can be represented in many forms and from many viewpoints, depending on the needs of the project and&#xD;
    the preferences of the project team. It need not be a formal document. The essence of the architecture can often be&#xD;
    communicated through a series of simple diagrams on a whiteboard; or as a list of decisions. Choose the medium that&#xD;
    best meets the needs of the project.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The architecture can be expressed as a simple metaphor or as a comparison to a predefined architectural style or set of&#xD;
    styles. It may be a precise set of models or documents that describe the various aspects of the system''s key elements.&#xD;
    Expressing it as skeletal build is another option - although this build may need to be baselined and preserved to&#xD;
    ensure that the essence of the system can be understood as the system grows.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Part of the architecture&amp;nbsp;frequently references architecturally significant portions of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../openup/workproducts/design_D677D182.html&quot; guid=&quot;_0WuL8slgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw&quot;>Design&lt;/a>. It can reference models that describe &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../openup/guidances/guidelines/architectural_view_FF6EDA37.html&quot; guid=&quot;_T9nygClEEduLGM8dfVsrKg&quot;>Architectural View&lt;/a>s for communicating the architecture. A view is a representation&#xD;
    of a system from the perspective of a related set of concerns.&amp;nbsp;To choose the appropriate set of&#xD;
    views,&amp;nbsp;identify the Stakeholders who depend on software architecture documentation and the information that they&#xD;
    need.&#xD;

            <MainDescription><![CDATA[<p>
    Layering logically partitions the system into sets of subsystems with certain rules regarding how relationships can be
    formed between them. Layering provides a way to restrict inter-subsystem dependencies, with the result that the system
    is more loosely coupled and more easily maintained.
</p>
<p>
    Consider the number and purpose of the layers carefully. Do not over-complicate the solution by defining more layers
    than are needed to meet the needs of the solution. More layers can always be added in the future to meet new
    requirements. Removing layers is not always as easy and may introduce risks into the project.
</p>
<p>
    The criteria for grouping subsystems follow a few patterns:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Visibility</b><strong>:</strong> Subsystems may depend only on subsystems in the same layer and the next-lower
        layer.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Volatility</b><strong>:</strong> 
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>In the highest layers</b>, put elements that vary when user requirements change.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>In the lowest layers</b>, put elements that vary when the implementation platform changes (hardware,
                language, operating system, database, and so forth).
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Sandwiched in the middle</strong>, put elements that are generally applicable across wide ranges of
                systems and implementation environments.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Add layers</strong> when additional partitions within these broad categories help to organize the
                model.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Generality</b><strong>:</strong> Abstract model elements tend to be placed lower in the model. If not
        implementation-specific, they tend to gravitate toward the middle layers.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Number of layers.</b> For a small system, three layers are typically sufficient.&nbsp;A three-layer architecture
        of&nbsp;Presentation, Business, and Data layers is very common in information systems.&nbsp; For a complex system,
        five to seven layers could be appropriate. For any degree of complexity, more than 10 layers should be viewed with
        suspicion that increases with the number of layers.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Failure to restrict dependencies according to Visibility criteria mentioned above can cause architectural degradation
    and make the system difficult to extend and maintain.
</p>
<p>
    Allowable exceptions to the visibility rule include cases where subsystems need direct access to lower-layer services
    beyond the next-lower layer. Make a decision about how to handle primitive services that are needed throughout the
    system, such as printing, sending messages, and so forth. There is little value in restricting messages to lower layers
    if the solution is to effectively implement call pass-throughs in the intermediate layers.&nbsp;&nbsp;This usage of a
    less strict rule on dependencies down through the layers is sometimes called a Relaxed Layered Architecture (<a class="elementlinkwithusertext" href="./../../../openup/guidances/supportingmaterials/references_6CCF393.html#BUS96" guid="_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg">[BUS96]</a>).
</p>
<h4>
    <a id="PartitioningPatterns" name="PartitioningPatterns">Partitioning patterns</a>
</h4>
<p>
    Within the top layers of the system, additional partitioning may help organize the model. The following guidelines for
    partitioning present different issues to consider:
</p>
<p>
    <b>User organization</b><strong>:</strong> Subsystems may be organized along lines that mirror the organization of
    functionality in the business organization (partitioning occurs along departmental or user role lines). This
    partitioning often occurs early in the design&nbsp;due to&nbsp;an existing enterprise model that is strongly
    partitioned according to the structure of the organization. This pattern usually affects only the top few layers of
    application-specific services and can often disappear as the design evolves.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            Partitioning along user-organization lines can be a good starting point for the model.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            The structure of the user organization is not stable over a long period of time because business
            reorganizations occur; therefore, it is not a good long-term basis for system partitioning. The internal
            organization of the system should enable the system to evolve and be maintained independently of the
            organization of the business that it supports.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <b>Areas of competence and skills:</b> Subsystems may be organized to partition responsibilities for parts of the model
    among different groups within the development organization. Typically, this occurs in the middle and lower layers of
    the system, and reflects the need for specialization in skills during the development and support of an infrastructure
    based on complex technology. Examples of such technologies include network and distribution management, database
    management, communication management, and process control, among others. Partitioning along competence lines may also
    occur in upper layers, where special competency in the problem domain is required to understand and support key
    business functionality. Examples include telecommunication call management, securities trading, insurance claims
    processing, and air traffic control, to name a few.
</p>
<p>
    <b>System distribution:</b> Within any of the layers of the system, the layers may be further partitioned horizontally,
    so to speak, to reflect the distribution of functionality.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            Partitioning to reflect distribution of functionality can help you visualize the network communication that
            will occur as the system runs.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Partitioning to reflect distribution can also, however, make the system more difficult to change if the
            deployment model changes significantly.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <b>Secrecy areas</b><strong>:</strong> Some applications, especially those requiring special security clearance to
    develop or support, require additional partitioning according to security access privileges. Software that controls
    access to secrecy areas must be developed and maintained by personnel with appropriate clearance. If the number of
    people with this background on the project is limited, the functionality requiring special clearance must be
    partitioned into subsystems that will be developed independently from other subsystems, with the interfaces to the
    secrecy areas the only visible aspect of these subsystems.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Variability areas:</b> Functionality that is likely to be optional, and therefore delivered only in some variants of
    the system, should be organized into independent subsystems that are developed and delivered independently from the
    mandatory functionality of the system.

            <MainDescription><![CDATA[<h4>
    Identify architectural goals
</h4>
<p>
    Architectural goals provide the motivation and rationale&nbsp;for decisions. These goals are&nbsp;often driven
    by&nbsp;the software requirements, particularly in&nbsp;<a class="elementLink" href="./../../../openup/workproducts/supporting_requirements_spec_7D9DD47C.html" guid="_BVh9cL-CEdqb7N6KIeDL8Q">Supporting Requirements Specification</a>, because they are not always&nbsp;obvious from&nbsp;the use cases alone [<a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../openup/guidances/supportingmaterials/references_6CCF393.html" guid="_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg">ALL02</a>].
</p>
<p>
    Architectural goals define how the system needs to respond to change over time. Consider these questions when writing
    your goals:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        What is the expected lifespan of the system?
    </li>
    <li>
        Will the system need to respond to technological changes over that time, such as new versions of middleware or
        other products?
    </li>
    <li>
        How&nbsp;frequently is&nbsp;the system&nbsp;expected to adapt to change?
    </li>
    <li>
        What changes can we anticipate in the future, and how can we make them easier to accommodate?
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    These considerations will have a significant effect on the structure of the system.
</p>
<h4>
    Identify architecturally significant requirements
</h4>
<p>
    Some of the requirements will be more significant than others when considered from an architectural perspective.
    Identifying them will define&nbsp;the subset of requirements that will generally need to be satisfied before the
    architecture can be stabilised. Furthermore, the system will generally be more sensitive to changes&nbsp;against
    architecturally significant requirements&nbsp;than others, so identifying and communicating ths subset will help others
    understand the potential implications of change.
</p>
<p>
    Requirements can be explicitly or implicitly architecturally significant. Implicitly significant requirements may
    define the essence of the functional behaviour of the system (for example, making a purchase from an on-line store).
    Explicitly significant requirements are often overtly technical in nature, such as performance targets; the need to
    interface to other systems; the number of users that must be supported; or security requirements.
</p>
<p>
    See <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../openup/guidances/guidelines/determine_architecturally_significant_requirements_817DFD9B.html" guid="_D3JXMNvKEduv2KOT-Teh6w">Determine Architecturally Significant Requirements</a>&nbsp;for more information.
</p>
<h4>
    Identify constraints on the architecture
</h4>
<p>
    Gather information about the existing&nbsp;environment and identify any constraints in the solution. This will ease
    integration with the environment; and may reduce risk, cost and duplication of solution elements.
</p>
<p>
    Architectural constraints can arise from various factors:
</p>
<div style="MARGIN-LEFT: 2em">
    <ul>
        <li>
            Network topology
        </li>
        <li>
            Use of a given database vendor or an existing database
        </li>
        <li>
            Web environment (server configurations, firewall, DMZs, and so forth)
        </li>
        <li>
            Servers (hardware model, operating system)
        </li>
        <li>
            Use of third-party software or a particular technology
        </li>
        <li>
            Compliance with existing standards
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>
<p>
    For example, if the company uses only one type of database, you will probably try to use it as much as possible to
    leverage&nbsp;the existing database administration skills, rather than introducing a new one.
</p>
<p>
    These architectural constraints, combined with the requirements, help you define&nbsp;an appropriate&nbsp;candidate for
    the system architecture.
</p>
<h4>
    Survey, assess, and select from available assets
</h4>
<p>
    To assess and select assets to reuse on your project, you need to understand the requirements of the system''s
    environment. You also need to understand the scope and general functionality of the system that the Stakeholders
    require. There are several types of assets to consider, including (but not limited to): reference architectures;
    frameworks; patterns; analysis mechanisms; classes; and experience. You can search asset&nbsp;repositories (internal or
    external to your organization) and industry literature to identify assets or similar projects.
</p>
<p>
    You need to assess whether available assets contribute to solving the key challenges of the current project and whether
    they are compatible with the project''s architectural constraints. You also need to analyze the extent of the fit
    between assets and requirements, considering whether any of the requirements are negotiable (to enable use of the
    asset). Also, assess whether the asset could be modified or extended to satisfy requirements, as well as what the
    tradeoffs in adopting it are, in terms of cost, risk, and functionality.
</p>
<p>
    Finally, decide, in principle, whether to use one or more assets, and record the rationale for this decision.
</p>
<h4>
    Define approach for structuring the system
</h4>
<p>
    Structuring your system helps you manage its complexity by using the well-known "divide and conquer" strategy. By
    breaking the process into smaller and more manageable pieces, you make development easier.
</p>
<p>
    Layering&nbsp; is&nbsp;one of the most&nbsp;commonly used&nbsp;approaches for structuring and decomposing systems. Each
    layer groups similar classes or components, which communicate insofar as possible only with adjacent layers.&nbsp; See
    <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../../openup/guidances/guidelines/layering_F169CF07.html" guid="_0gpkAMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">Guideline: Layering</a> for more information.
</p>
<p>
    You do not define which layers contain which classes or components. Instead, you define how many layers you will need
    and which kinds of layers you will use. For example, if you are developing a new middleware system, you probably do not
    need a business layer. Later, during&nbsp;design activities, you decide which classes and components will populate
    these layers.
</p>
<h4>
    Define approach for deploying the system
</h4>
<p>
    Develop a high level overview of how the software is deployed. For example, determine if the system needs to be
    accessed remotely, or has requirements that suggest distribution across multiple nodes. Some sources of information to
    consider are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        users at geographical locations
    </li>
    <li>
        organization of business data
    </li>
    <li>
        service level requirements
    </li>
    <li>
        constraints (such as requirements to interface with legacy systems)
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Validate that the deployment overview supports users (especially those users at remote locations if this is required)
    performing typical&nbsp;usage scenarios&nbsp;while satisfying nonfunctional requirements and constraints. Validate that
    the nodes and connections are adequate to support the interactions between components on different nodes, and between
    components and their stored data.
</p>
<h4>
    Identify key abstractions
</h4>
<p>
    Requirements and analysis tasks usually uncover key concepts and behaviors that the system must be able to handle.
</p>
<p>
    The concepts manifest in design as key abstractions.&nbsp;Key behaviors should correlate with the scenarios identifed
    as part of the architecturally significant requirements and represent the important interactions between key
    abstractions.
</p>
<p>
    The <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../openup/workproducts/vision_2E71B03C.html" guid="_0WVxcMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">Vision</a> and <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../openup/workproducts/glossary_5D300778.html" guid="_Wn7HcNcEEdqz_d2XWoVt6Q">Glossary</a> work products are
    good sources for key abstractions. These abstractions are often easily identified because they represent things that
    are significant to the business. For example, Customer and Account are typical key abstractions in the banking
    business.
</p>
<p>
    The abstractions that&nbsp;are identified at this point will also probably change and evolve during the course of the
    project. The purpose of this step is not to identify&nbsp;the complete&nbsp;set of classes and relationships that will
    survive throughout design.&nbsp;Rather, it is&nbsp;to identify the&nbsp;important&nbsp;concepts that the system must
    handle. The value in calling them out early in the project is that everyone on the team understands the importance of
    these&nbsp;concepts and develops&nbsp;coherant software to handle them consistently.
</p>
<p>
    Don''t spend too much time describing&nbsp;abstractions in detail at this initial stage, because there is a risk that
    spending too much time will result in identifying classes and relationships that the solution does not actually need.
    When&nbsp;identifying&nbsp;key abstractions, it can be useful to also define any obvious relationships that exist
    between them.&nbsp;These can be captured in a table or&nbsp;in diagrams (in a tool or whiteboard), and create a short
    description for each abstraction.&nbsp;In general, it is not worth agonizing over defining a highly detailed set of
    relationships at this early stage in design. The relationships will become more concrete and detailed later and
    will&nbsp;probably modify&nbsp;these early&nbsp;assumptions.
</p>
<h4>
    Identify&nbsp;architecture mechanisms
</h4>
<p>
    See&nbsp;<a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../../openup/guidances/concepts/arch_mech_2932DFB6.html" guid="_mzxI0A4LEduibvKwrGxWxA">Concept: Architectural Mechanism</a>.
</p>
<h4>
    Capture architectural decisions
</h4>
<p>
    It is often useful to record key architectural decisions and working assumptions on an architectural overview diagram
    to make it easier to communicate the architecture to the project team and stakeholders.&nbsp;This information should be
    part of the description of the architecture, but it can vary in format to suit the needs of the project.&nbsp;For
    example, on an agile and low-ceremony project the overview diagram can be an informal picture story board or a graph
    with icons on either a whiteboard or a drawing tool. The illustration needs to show the nature of the proposed
    solution, convey the governing ideas, and represent the major building blocks.
</p>
<p>
    Architecture decisions should be captured in the <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../../openup/workproducts/architecture_notebook_9BB92433.html" guid="_0XAf0MlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">Artifact: Architecture Notebook</a>.
</p>
<p>
    If a more complex system is required, then the architecture can be represented as a more comprehensive set
    of&nbsp;views that describe the architecture from a number of viewpoints. See <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../openup/guidances/guidelines/architectural_view_FF6EDA37.html" guid="_T9nygClEEduLGM8dfVsrKg">Architectural View</a>&nbsp;for more information.<br />

            <MainDescription><![CDATA[<p>
    The value in defining architecture mechanisms is that they:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Explicitly calls out aspects of the solution mechanics that are common across the system. This helps you plan.
    </li>
    <li>
        Puts down markers for the developers to build those aspects of the system once, and then re-use them. This reduces
        the workload.
    </li>
    <li>
        Promotes the development of a consistent set of services. This makes the system easier to maintain.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    An architectural mechanism can have three states: analysis, design, and nmplementation. These categories reflect the
    maturity of the mechanism''s description. The state changes as successive levels of detail are uncovered when you refine
    architecturally significant requirements into working software. The categories are summarized in the table that

    Be aware that these states are frequently referred to themselves as analysis, design, and implementation mechanisms.
    These are synonyms, and merely represent the architectural mechanisms in different states of development. The
    transition from one state to another can often be obvious or intuitive. Therefore, it can be achieved in a matter of
    seconds. On the other hand, it can also require more considered analysis and design, thus take longer. The following
    diagram illustrates the transition of architectural mechanisms from one state to another.
</p>
<p>
    The important point here is that these categories of mechanisms apply to the same concept in different states. The only
    difference between them is one of refinement or detail. Refer to&nbsp;<a class="elementLink"
    href="./../../../openup/guidances/concepts/arch_mech.html" guid="_mzxI0A4LEduibvKwrGxWxA">Architectural
    Mechanism</a>&nbsp;for more background information. See <a class="elementLinkWithType"

    Architectural Mechanisms</a>&nbsp;for a list of typical mechanisms.
</p>
<p>
    The main reason for using architecture mechanisms as an approach to analysis and design is that they facilitate the
    evolution of architecturally significant aspects of the system. They allow the team to maintain a cohesive architecture
    whilst enabling implementation details to be deferred until they really need to be made.

<p>
    Architectural mechanisms represent key aspects of the technical solution that need to be standardized across the
    project. Everyone on the project should handle these concepts in the same way, and re-use the same mechanisms in their
    code.
</p>
<p>
    Architectural Mechanisms are used to satisfy architecturally significant requirements. They often equate to technical
    services or framework components in the software, and form the basis for standardizing the way that the software works.
    Therefore, they are an important element of the overall software architecture. Defining architectural mechanisms also
    enables you to make decisions about whether existing software components can be reused to provide the required
    behavior, or whether new software should be bought or built.
</p>
<p>
    The key point to understand when discussing architectural mechanisms is that defining them is all about making choices
    about <b>what</b> technology will be used to satisfy architecturally significant requirements. It is not about
    producing detailed design up front. This is a common misunderstanding. Creating detailed design and software that shows
    <b>how</b> specific mechanisms are satisfied is a development task.

    Business Patterns are a form of Design Pattern&nbsp;(see <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../../openup/guidances/concepts/pattern_10BE6D96.html" guid="_0YJvUMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">Concept: Pattern</a>) and

Just as similar problems in the technical domain may be solved by using Architecture Mechanisms, similar
    problems in the business domain can be solved by using Business Patterns.
</p>
<p>
    Business Patterns are often found in COTS products. For example, packaged applications that support Enterprise Resource
    Planning or Customer Relationship Management ship with functionality to support a variety of generic business
    processes. Similarly, it is frequently possible to identify related or similar behavior in the Use
    Case&nbsp;Scenarios&nbsp;and thereby derive generic designs that you can use in the design of the system. These
    elements of generic behavior can be&nbsp;expressed as Design&nbsp;Patterns and applied to the system design.

            <MainDescription><![CDATA[<h1> Identify architecturally significant design elements </h1>
<p align="left"> Consider&nbsp;each high-priority&nbsp;scenario that is within 
  the scope of the project. Walk through the actions that the&nbsp;scenario initiates, 
  and highlight the areas of the architecture that are factors in realizing, or 
  implementing, the requirements. </p>
<p>
    Identifying components will help hide the complexity of the system and help you work at a higher level. Components need
    to be internally cohesive and to provide external services through a limited interface. Component identification can
    be&nbsp;based on architectural layers, deployment choices, or key abstractions. Ask yourself these questions:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        What is logically or functionally related (same use case or service, for example)?
    </li>
    
  <li> What entities provide services to multiple other services? </li>
    <li>
        What entities depend on each other? Strongly or weakly?
    </li>
    <li>
        What entities should you be able to exchange independently from others?
    </li>
    <li>
        What will run on the same processor or network node?
    </li>
    <li>
        What parts are constrained by similar performance requirements?
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Each component includes entities from the problem domain, control classes that coordinate complex tasks within
    components, and interfaces that handle communication with the environment. The interface for each instantiated element
    is identified. At this point, interfaces do not need to be as detailed as a signature, but they do need to document
    what the elements need, what they can use, and what they can depend on.
</p>
<p>
    Identified patterns define the types of elements, but not a specific number. Apply the chosen patterns to define a new
    set of elements that conform to the patterns. Functionality will be allocated to the instantiated elements.
</p>
<h1> Refine&nbsp;the Architectural Mechanisms </h1>
<p> Consider each high-priority quality scenario, and map each of these onto the 
  Architectural Mechanisms. Refine the mechanisms to identify the specific technology&nbsp;that 
  will handle each mechanism within the scope. For example, for the Persistence 
  mechanism, it may be appropriate to&nbsp;use a relational database management 
  system, such as MySQL.&nbsp;Consider the selection of technology in the context 
  of the requirements and constraints. </p>
<p>
    See <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../../openup/guidances/concepts/arch_mech_2932DFB6.html" guid="_mzxI0A4LEduibvKwrGxWxA">Concept: Architectural Mechanism</a> for more information.
</p>
<h2 align="left"> Map the software to the hardware </h2>
<p align="left"> Produce a precise map of deployable software components to network 
  nodes. </p>
<h2> Define development and test architectures </h2>
<p> The configuration of the environments where the system is developed and tested 
  may be different from the target production environment, and this may have an 
  impact on the solution. For example:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Additional software may needed to be developed to support testing.
    </li>
    <li>
        Alternative deployment configurations may need to be defined for different environments in response to constraints
        on development and test&nbsp;hardware.
    </li>
    <li>
        Multiple environments may be required to support different categories of tests (such as&nbsp;performance testing or
        user acceptance testing). These will need to be specified.
    </li>
</ul>
<p> These scenarios, although not desirable, are often forced on the team through 
  various constraints. Consequently, the architecture for these different environments 
  will need to be specified&nbsp;with particular attention paid to significant 
  differences. Be sure to consider the impact of any differences on the quality 
  of the overall target production architecture. </p>
<h2> Validate the architecture </h2>
<p> The surest way to validate the architecture is through software. The software 
  developed up to the end of the Elaboration phase is largely aiming to validate 
  the architecture (to the point where it can be baselined), thereby providing 
  some level of stability during the Construction phase. </p>
<p> It can also be useful to perform simple validation by walking through the 
  main design concepts and models, perhaps by using a whiteboard or through other 
  collaborative techniques. This can help refine thinking but will not act as 
  a substitute for building some software. </p>
<h2> Communicate decisions </h2>
<p> You can document and communicate your decisions as many ways as you wish, 
  for example:</p>
<ul>
    
  <li> Publication of&nbsp;reference source code</li>
    
  <li> Publication of&nbsp;reference models</li>
    
  <li> Publication of&nbsp;software architecture documentation</li>
    
  <li> Formal&nbsp;presentations of the material</li>
    
  <li> Informal walkthroughs of the architecture</li>

    <li>
        <p>
            Use-case view: Describes functionality of the system, its external interfaces, and its principal users. The

            elements of the architecture should be derived from requirements.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Logical view: Describes how the system is structured in terms of units of implementation. The elements are
            packages, classes, and interfaces. The relationship between elements shows dependencies, interface
            realizations, part-whole relationships, and so forth. Note: This view is mandatory when using the 4+1 Views of

            Process view: Describes how the run-time system is structured as a set of elements that have run-time behavior
            and interactions. Run-time structure often bears little resemblance to the code structure. It consists of
            rapidly changing networks of communication objects. The elements are components that have run-time presence
            (processes, threads, Enterprise JavaBeans&trade; (EJB&trade;), servlets, DLLs, and so on), data stores, and complex
            connectors, such as queues. Interaction between elements varies, based on technology. This view is useful for
            thinking about run-time system quality attributes, such as performance and reliability. This view is optional
            when using the 4+1 Views.

    Software&nbsp;development is a pursuit characterized by complexity. This can take many forms, such as accommodating
    complex requirements, technology, or team dynamics. Elevating the level of abstraction helps you manage this complexity
    and make measurable progress, despite the inherent difficulty of the task.
</p>
<p>
    Suggestions for several strategies that help abstract away complexity follow.
</p>
<h4>
    Leverage patterns
</h4>
<p>
    Patterns help you take advantage of proven techniques for solving common problems. You can benefit from the experience
    of seasoned practitioners and avoid "re-inventing the wheel," as the saying goes. The use of patterns is a crucial
    aspect of an architecture-centric approach to development, because it helps reduce the novelty and diversity of a
    solution, thus improves quality.
</p>
<p>
    See <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../../openup/guidances/concepts/pattern_10BE6D96.html" guid="_0YJvUMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">Concept: Pattern</a>&nbsp;for more information.
</p>
<h4>
    Design the architecture with components and services
</h4>
<p>
    This strategy helps manage software complexity through&nbsp;partitioning&nbsp;a system into a set of loosely coupled
    and highly cohesive subsystems. The benefits of this approach include the ability to organize the team around a set of
    smaller, more manageable objectives, and the ability to substitute parts of the system without disturbing the overall
    cohesion of the system. Exposing services encourages re-use by making the functionality of the system easier to
    comprehend. Focusing on services makes it possible to understand what the system does from a technical perspective
    without necessarily having to understand the details of how the system works.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<h4>
    Actively promote reuse
</h4>
<p>
    Incorporating existing software into an overall architecture helps reduce cost and improve quality by reusing proven
    working software, rather than developing from scratch. It also helps reduce the burden of maintenance by eliminating
    duplication in the software. Although often difficult to manage, a project or enterprise can reap significant benefits
    from a well-executed re-use strategy.

            <MainDescription><![CDATA[<h1>
    Introduction
</h1>
<p>
    Software architecture is a concept that is easy to understand, and that most engineers intuitively feel, especially
    with a little experience, but it is hard to precisely define. In particular, it is difficult to draw a sharp line
    between design and architecture -- architecture is one aspect of design that concentrates on some specific features.
</p>
<p>
    In <i>An Introduction to Software Architecture</i>, David Garlan and Mary Shaw suggest that software architecture is a level
    of design concerned with issues: "Beyond the algorithms and data structures of the computation; designing and
    specifying the overall system structure emerges as a new kind of problem. Structural issues include gross organization
    and global control structure; protocols for communication, synchronization, and data access; assignment of
    functionality to design elements; physical distribution; composition of design elements; scaling and performance; and
    selection among design alternatives." <a class="elementlinkwithusertext" href="./../../../openup/guidances/supportingmaterials/references_6CCF393.html#GAR93" guid="_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg">[GAR93]</a>
</p>
<p>
    But there is more to architecture than just structure; the IEEE Working Group on Architecture defines it as "the
    highest-level concept of a system in its environment" <a class="elementlinkwithusertext" href="./../../../openup/guidances/supportingmaterials/references_6CCF393.html#IEP1471" guid="_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg">[IEP1471]</a>. It also encompasses the "fit" with system integrity, with economical
    constraints, with aesthetic concerns, and with style. It is not limited to an inward focus, but takes into
    consideration the system as a whole in its user environment and its development environment -- an outward focus.
</p>
<p>
    In this process, the architecture of a software system (at a given point) is the organization or structure of the
    system''s significant components interacting through interfaces, with components composed of successively smaller
    components and interfaces.
</p>
<h1>
    Architecture Description
</h1>
<p>
    To speak and reason about software architecture, you must first define an architectural representation, a way of
    describing important aspects of an architecture. This description is captured in the <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../../openup/workproducts/architecture_notebook_9BB92433.html" guid="_0XAf0MlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">Artifact: Architecture Notebook</a>.
</p>
<h1>
    Architectural views
</h1>
<p>
    The software architecture can be represented in multiple architectural views. Each architectural view addresses
    some specific set of concerns, specific to stakeholders in the development process: users, designers, managers, system
    engineers, maintainers, and so on.
</p>
<p>
    The views capture the major structural design decisions by showing how the software architecture is decomposed into
    components, and how components are connected by connectors to produce useful forms <a class="elementlinkwithusertext" href="./../../../openup/guidances/supportingmaterials/references_6CCF393.html#DEW92" guid="_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg">[DEW92]</a>. These design choices must be tied to the requirements -- functional and
    supplementary -- and other constraints. But these choices in turn put further constraints on the requirements, and
    on future design decisions at a lower level.
</p>
<h1>
    Architectural Focus
</h1>
<p>
    Although the views above could represent the whole design of a system, the architecture concerns itself only with some
    specific aspects:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>The structure of the model:</b> the organizational patterns, for example, Layering
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>The essential elements:</b> critical use cases, main classes, common mechanisms, and so on, as opposed to all the
        elements present in the model
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>A few key scenarios</b> showing the main control flows throughout the system
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>The services</b>, to capture modularity, optional features, product-line aspects
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    In essence, architectural views are abstractions (or simplifications) of the entire design, in which important
    characteristics are made more visible by leaving details aside. These characteristics are important when reasoning
    about:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        System evolution: going to the next development cycle
    </li>
    <li>
        Reuse of the architecture, or parts of it, in the context of a product line
    </li>
    <li>
        Assessing supplementary qualities, such as performance, availability, portability, and safety
    </li>
    <li>
        Assigning development work to teams or subcontractors
    </li>
    <li>
        Decisions about including off-the-shelf components
    </li>
    <li>
        Insertion in a wider system
    </li>
</ul>
<h1>
    Architectural Patterns
</h1>
<p>
    Architectural patterns are ready-made forms that solve recurring architectural problems. An architectural framework or
    an architectural infrastructure (middleware) is a set of components on which you can build a certain kind of
    architecture. Many of the major architectural difficulties should be resolved in the framework or in the
    infrastructure, usually targeted to a specific domain: command and control, MIS, control system, and so on.
</p>

            <MainDescription><![CDATA[<p>
    Architectural mechanisms represent key technical concepts that&nbsp;will be standardized across the solution. They are
    refined&nbsp;during the project through three states, represented by the three categories of Architectural Mechanisms:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Analysis Mechanisms</strong>, which give the mechanism a name, brief description and some basic
        attributes&nbsp;derived from&nbsp;the project requirements
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Design Mechanisms</strong>, which are more concrete and assume some details of the implementation
        environment
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Implementation Mechanisms</strong>, which specify the&nbsp;exact implementation of&nbsp;each mechanism
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    When the <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../openup/roles/architect.html"
    guid="_0X9iEMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">Architect</a> initially identifies an&nbsp;architectural mechanism they are putting down
    a marker that says to the team, "We are going to handle this aspect of the system in a standard way. We''ll figure out
    the details later." As the project proceeds, the architectural mechanisms are gradually refined until they become part
    of the software.
</p>
<h4>
    Analysis Mechanisms
</h4>
<p>
    Analysis mechanisms&nbsp;are the initial state for an architectural mechanism. They are identified early in the project
    and represent&nbsp;bookmarks for future software development. They allow the&nbsp;team to focus on understanding the
    requirements without getting distracted by the specifics of a complex implementation. Analysis mechanisms are
    discovered by surveying the requirements and looking for recurrent technical concepts.&nbsp;Security, persistence and
    legacy interface are some examples of these. In effect, the <a class="elementLink"
    href="./../../../openup/roles/architect.html" guid="_0X9iEMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">Architect</a> is collating the
    requirements that describe&nbsp;architecturally significant topics bringing them together in a single list. This makes
    them easier to manage.
</p>
<p>
    Analysis mechanisms are described in simple terms:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Name:</strong> Identifies the mechanism.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Basic attributes:</strong> Define the requirements of the mechanism. These attributes can vary depending
        upon the mechanism being analyzed. Refer to <a class="elementLinkWithType"
        href="./../../../openup/guidances/examples/architectural_mechanism_attributes.html"
        guid="_eQ_s8Om5Edupia_tZIXEqg">Example: Architectural Mechanism Attributes</a>&nbsp;for more guidance.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Once the list of analysis mechanisms has been defined it can be prioritized and the mechanisms refined in line
    with&nbsp;iteration&nbsp;objectives. It is not necessary to develop the entire set of architecture mechanisms into
    working software in a single pass. It is often more sensible to develop only those mechanisms required to support the
    functionality to be delivered in the current iteration.
</p>
<h4>
    Design Mechanisms
</h4>
<p>
    Design mechanisms&nbsp;represent decisions about the concrete technologies that are going to be used to&nbsp;develop
    architectural mechanisms. For example, the decision to use an RDBMS for persistence. It''s often no more complicated
    than that (though of course, the effort involved in making the decision can sometimes be quite complex).
</p>
<p>
    The decision on when to refine an architectural mechanism from an analysis state to a design state is largely
    arbitrary. Often there will be constraints on the project that&nbsp;force the decision on some of these issues. For
    example, there may be a corporate standard for databases which mean that the decision&nbsp;for the&nbsp;persistence
    mechanism can be made on day 1 of the project.
</p>
<p>
    On other occasions the decision may point to products that the project team has not yet acquired.&nbsp;If so,&nbsp;the
    decision needs to be made in time to enable the required products to be made available to the team.
</p>
<p>
    It can often be useful to develop some prototype code to prove that these decisions are sound. The <a
    class="elementLink" href="./../../../openup/roles/architect.html" guid="_0X9iEMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">Architect</a> should
    be confident that the technologies being selected are able to fulfill the requirements. The attributes captured against
    the corresponding analysis mechanisms should be used as criteria to prove the validity of the decisions.
</p>
<h4>
    Implementation Mechanism
</h4>
<p>
    An implementation mechanism&nbsp;specifies the actual implementation for the architectural mechanism (hence the
    name).&nbsp;It can be modeled as a design pattern or presented as&nbsp;example code.
</p>
<p>
    The best time to&nbsp;produce the&nbsp;implementation mechanism is usually when the first piece of functionality that
    needs it is scheduled for development. The <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../openup/roles/architect.html"
    guid="_0X9iEMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">Architect</a> and <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../openup/roles/developer.html"
    guid="_0YDosMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">Developer</a> work together to develop this.

            <MainDescription><![CDATA[<p> The selection of requirements that are considered "architecturally significant" 
  is driven by several key driving factors:</p>
<ul>
    
  <li> The benefit of the requirement to stakeholders: critical, <b>important</b>, 
    or<b> useful</b>. </li>
  <li> The architectural impact of the requirement:<b> none</b>, <b>extends</b>, 
    or <b>modifies</b>. There may be critical requirements that have little or 
    no impact on the architecture and low-benefit requirements that have a big 
    impact. Low-benefit requirements with big architectural impacts should be 
    reviewed by the project manager for possible removal from the scope of the 
    project.</li>
    
  <li> The risks to be mitigated: performance, availability of a product, and 
    suitability of a component. </li>
    <li>
        The completion of the coverage of the architecture.
    </li>
    
  <li> Other tactical objectives or constraints, such as demonstration to the 
    user, and so on. </li>
</ul>
<p> There may be two requirements that hit the same components and address similar 
  risks. If you implement A first, then B is not architecturally significant. 
  If you implement B first, then A is not architecturally significant. Thus these 
  attributes can depend on the iteration order and should be re-evaluated when 
  the order changes, as well as when the requirements themselves change. </p>
<p>
    Architecturally significant requirements that are poorly understood or likely to change should be prioritized for
    clarification and stabilization. In some cases, this means further requirements analysis should be done before
    implementing the requirement. In other cases, some form of prototyping may be best.

            <MainDescription><![CDATA[<p>
    An executable architecture is a <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../openup/workproducts/build_95D7D8FD.html" guid="_0YuXEMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">Build</a>
    that realizes a subset of the architecture. This build is used to validate that a subset of the <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../openup/guidances/concepts/architecturally_significant_requirements_1EE5D757.html" guid="_HrZGIA4MEduibvKwrGxWxA">Architecturally Significant Requirements</a>&nbsp;is correctly implemented. The subset
    will include all architecturally significant requirements when the architecture is complete. It validates the
    architecture as an integrated whole through integration tests. The team gains feedback about the architecture from the
    customer or stakeholder by providing the executable architecture for verification. This way the executable architecture
    helps to assure that the core functionality is stable enough to build the remainder of the system.
</p>
<p>
    An executable architecture is not a work product. It’s an identification or attribute of a build indicating the build
    contains stable architecturally significant functionality.
</p>
<p>
    Each version of an executable architecture should be more complete and robust than previous versions. The final
    executable architecture contains all the elements that make up the architecture and should validate all architecturally
    significant requirements. There may be rare exceptions where a portion of the architecture can''t practically be
    implemented until later due to uncontrollable circumstances such as constraints with third part software or unique
    resources that are unavailable.&nbsp;Delaying any part of the architecture should be avoided as it raises significant
    technical risk later in the project. But if circumstances dictate that some architectural risk can''t be mitigated
    until&nbsp;later in development, a&nbsp;conscious decision can be made to carry this risk forward until the
    architecture can be fully implemented. In this case, the executable architecture will not contain the entire <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../openup/guidances/concepts/software_architecture_59A08DE0.html" guid="__O7tAMVvEduLYZUGfgZrkQ">Software Architecture</a>.
</p>
<p>
    It''s also possible to include non-architectural elements into an executable architecture. This will most likely happen
    when addressing high risk issues early in the development cycle, which is an excellent practice. Two examples of
    non-technical risks are resource risks and competitive risks. It may be desireable to obtain a difficult-to-get
    resource early so they can work on a unique piece of the software now, rather than hoping the resource will be
    available later. Or it may be useful to implement and deploy some early features to maintain market share against a
    competitor. Think of the executable architecture as a way to mitigate architectural risk, which is the most significant
    technical risk in a project. From this perspective, it''s appropriate to mitigate other risks in the executable
    architecture.
</p>
<p>
    The difference between the executable architecture and a build from later in the development cycle is that the
    executable architecture is the result of a period of development (for example&nbsp;an iteration) that''s dedicated to
    elaborating the architecture. Later iterations build onto the executable architecture but are not flagged as an
    executable architecture because they extend the system''s functionality beyond the architectural framework.

    The following shows how to capture information for <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../openup/guidances/concepts/arch_mech_2932DFB6.html" guid="_mzxI0A4LEduibvKwrGxWxA">Architectural Mechanism</a>s. This example shows two possible mechanisms: Persistence and Communication.
</p>
<h1>
    Persistence
</h1>
<p>
    For all classes with instances that may become persistent, you need to identify:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            <b>Granularity</b><b>:</b> What is the range of size of the objects to keep persistent?
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <b>Volume</b><b>:</b> How many objects (number) do you need to keep persistent?
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <b>Duration</b><b>:</b> How long does the object typically need to be kept?
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <b>Retrieval mechanism</b><b>:</b> How is a given object uniquely identified and retrieved?
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <b>Update frequency</b><b>:</b> Are the objects more or less constant? Are they permanently updated?
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <b>Reliability</b><b>:</b> Do the objects need to survive a crash of the process, the processor, or
            the whole system?
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h1>
    Communication
</h1>
<p>
    For all model elements that need to communicate with components or services that are running in other processes or
    threads, you need to identify:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            <b>Latency</b><b>:</b> How fast must processes communicate with another?
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <b>Synchronicity</b><b>:</b> Asynchronous communication
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <b>Size of message</b><b>:</b> A spectrum might be more appropriate than a single number
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <b>Protocol:</b> Flow control, buffering, and so on
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Notice that there is no design-level information or specification here. Instead, this is more about collating and
    refining architecturally significant requirements.

              <MainDescription><![CDATA[<p>
    A use-case realization represents how a use case will be implemented in terms of collaborating objects. The
    realizations reside within the design. By walking through a design exercise of showing how the design elements will
    perform the use case, the team gets confirmation that the design is robust enough to perform the required behavior.
</p>
<p>
    The realization can take various forms. It may include, for example, a textual description (a document), class diagrams
    of participating classes and subsystems, and interaction diagrams (communication and sequence diagrams) that illustrate
    the flow of interactions between class and subsystem instances.
</p>
<p>
    The reason for separating the use-case realization from its use case is that doing so allows the requirements, in the
    form of use cases, to be managed separately from the design, in the form of realizations. This decoupling will prove
    invaluable if the architecture is changed enough that the realization needs to be reworked while the requirements
    remain unaffected. Even without such a circumstance, the clear separation of concerns between requirements and design
    is valuable.
</p>
<p>
    In a model, a use-case realization is represented as a UML (Unified Modeling Language) collaboration that groups the
    diagrams and other information (such as textual descriptions) that form the use-case realization.
</p>
<p>
    Like other aspects of the design, the UML diagrams that support use-case realizations can be produced at various levels
    of abstraction. A first pass in creating the realization might produce a diagram at an analysis level of abstraction
    where the participants will be high-level elements that are expected to be revisited and detailed down to the design
    level in&nbsp;a second pass. If the architecture and design idioms are well-understood, the realization could
    immediately be created at a low level of abstraction that specifies more detail on the elements and how they will
    collaborate to&nbsp;realize the behavior of the use case. In the latter case, it is valuable to model patterns and
    architectural mechanisms to reduce the amount of low-level detail in each realization.
</p>
<p>
    For each use case in the requirements, there can be a use-case realization in the design with a realization
    relationship to the use case, as the following figure shows. In UML, this is shown as a dashed arrow with an arrowhead,
    like a generalization relationship, indicating that a realization is a kind of inheritance, as well as a dependency
    (see the figure that follows).

<h1>
    Class diagrams owned by a use case realization
</h1>For each use-case realization, there may be one or more class diagrams that depict its participating classes. A class
and its objects often participate in several use-case realizations. While designing, it is important to coordinate all of
the requirements related to a class that different use-case realizations may have. The figure below shows an
analysis&nbsp;class diagram for the realization of the Receive Deposit Item use case. Notice the use of
boundary-control-entity stereotypes to represent analysis classes (see <a class="elementLinkWithType"
href="./../../../openup/guidances/guidelines/entity_control_boundary_pattern.html"
guid="_uF-QYEAhEdq_UJTvM1DM2Q">Guideline: Entity-Control-Boundary Pattern</a>).

</p><br align="center" />
<br />
<h1>
    Sequence and communication diagrams
</h1>
<p>
    For each use-case realization, there&nbsp;can be&nbsp;one or more interaction diagrams that depict&nbsp;the
    participating objects and their interactions. There are two types of interaction diagrams: <i>sequence</i> diagrams and
    <i>communication</i> diagrams. They express similar information, but show it in different ways.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Sequence diagrams</b> show the explicit sequence of messages and are better when it is important to visualize
        the time order of messages.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Communication diagrams</b> show the communication links between objects and are better for understanding all of
        the effects on a given object and for algorithm design.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Realizing use cases through interaction diagrams helps to keep the design simple and cohesive. Assigning
    responsibilities to classes on the basis of what the use-case scenario explicitly requires encourages the design to
    contain the following elements:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Only the functionality actually used in support of a use-case scenario
    </li>
    <li>
        Functionality that can be tested through an associated test case
    </li>
    <li>
        Functionality that is more easily traceable to requirements and changes
    </li>
    <li>
        Explicitly declared class dependencies that are easier to manage
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    These factors help improve the overall quality of the system.

              <MainDescription><![CDATA[<h3>
    Introduction
</h3>
<p>
    Using visual modeling techniques to design software can help break down complex problems into a series of smaller,
    easier to manage tasks. Sharing pictures rather than written documents or source code also helps the understanding and
    communication of difficult concepts. Adopting standard modeling notations such as the UML increases this capability by
    helping to make diagrams precise and unambiguous.
</p>
<p>
    The degree of formality used when producing and disseminating models should vary according to your needs. Small,
    collaborative teams modeling around whiteboards and capturing the results on a sheet of paper or with digital cameras
    can yield good results. This can also help the team focus on producing software with the help of models; rather than
    becoming sidetracked into over-engineering both the models and the solution. Modeling tools provide additional value to
    projects, especially for more complex systems. Their specifics of use are outside the scope of this guideline, however.
</p>
<p>
    This guideline does not describe a formal sequential progression through prescriptive design steps. Whether some or all
    of these techniques are needed, or how long is spent on them will vary depending on real-world issues such as the
    complexity of the requirements; the experience of the designer; and the way the team works.
</p>
<p>
    This guideline uses a simplified scenario (Login) to help keep the focus on understanding the techniques rather than
    the specific requirements. In the real-world, it is doubtful that much time would be spent modeling a simple problem.
    Here is the use case diagram, for reference;
</p>

</p>
<h3>
    Identify elements
</h3>
<p>
    Render the identified design elements as classes in a UML diagram.&nbsp; Apply appropriate stereotypes and optionally
    render the class using an icon specific to the stereotype to characterize the intent of the class in the design.&nbsp;
    Name and briefly describe the classes in a few sentences. Do not spend too much time working on associations, as these
    will be developed through working on collaborations in the next step.
</p>
<p>
    Classes can be drawn as a basic UML rectangle or with a specific symbol associated with a particular stereotype.
</p>
<p>
    The resulting class diagram should be conceptually similar to this one:
</p>
<p>
    <img height="228" alt="Identify Elements - Initial Class Model" src="openup/guidances/guidelines/resources/identify_elements_bce.JPG"
    width="290" />
</p>
<p>
    For this example, the <a class="elementLink"
    href="./../../../openup/guidances/guidelines/entity_control_boundary_pattern.html"
    guid="_uF-QYEAhEdq_UJTvM1DM2Q">Entity-Control-Boundary Pattern</a> has been used to derive two classes (LoginUI and
    LoginController). In addition, two design elements already identified in the architecture (SecuritySystemInterface and
    User) have also been incorporated.
</p>
<h3>
    Determine how elements collaborate to realize the scenario.
</h3>
<p>
    When determining collaboration, two kinds of diagrams are useful.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        A dynamic object diagram, showing how the design elements collaborate to realize the requirements.
    </li>
    <li>
        A static class diagram, showing the classes involved in realizing the requirements.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Remember to also update any other impacted diagrams as appropriate, based on modifications or additions to the design.
</p>
<p>
    Create a number of dynamic object diagrams that walk through how a set of objects collaborate to perform the behavior
    of the scenarios.&nbsp; Even if just one scenario is being designed, this might take multiple diagrams to render it in
    smaller, understandable chunks or from multiple contexts.
</p>
<p>
    <img style="WIDTH: 776px; HEIGHT: 355px" height="355" alt="User Login Sequence Diagram"
    src="openup/guidances/guidelines/resources/user_login_seq.JPG" width="776" />
</p>
<p>
    The above sequence diagram shows the user credentials being passed through to the security system for authentication.
    Steps in the use case scenario are transformed into messages between the participating objects. The messages in this
    example are not yet fully formed (there are no parameters or return values), so they are prefixed with “//” to show
    that more work is needed.&nbsp; A sequence diagram was used in this example, but a communication diagram could have
    been used.
</p>
<p>
    It&nbsp;can be&nbsp;useful to create one or more static class diagrams that show the classes in the design that support
    the realization.&nbsp; These class diagrams are often called View of Participating Classes diagrams, they provide a
    focused view on the overall design by only showing the classes, relationships, operations, and attributes relevant to
    the collaboration.
</p>
<p>
    <img height="469" alt="Login VOPC" src="openup/guidances/guidelines/resources/login_vopc.jpg" width="448" />
</p>
<p>
    This diagram shows the operations and relationships that were identified by drawing the sequence diagram. The
    relationships in this example&nbsp;have not been refined yet, so they are just shown as simple associations. Remember
    to examine the diagram to verify that the design can support the behavior in the sequence diagram.
</p>
<p>
    Working at this level of detail in the model during the early stages of design can be helpful. It keeps the diagrams
    relatively simple and easy to understand. It makes them easier to draw in a workshop and easier to change during
    discussion. It is often easier to add the detail once there is agreement on the fundamentals.
</p>
<h3>
    Refine design decisions
</h3>
<p>
    Once the fundamentals of the design are relatively stable, you can begin to add detail to the design. Some of this can
    be performed in code or in the model. If modeling is chosen, then refine attributes, responsibilities and
    relationships.
</p>
<h4>
    Describe responsibilities
</h4>
<p>
    Class responsibilities are either actions to be performed by an object or knowledge maintained and provided to other
    objects. Each class will typically have several responsibilities; each responsibility will evolve into one or more
    operations during design.
</p>
<p>
    Responsibilities are derived from messages on interaction diagrams or from non-functional requirements that a class has
    to support. Document a responsibility by giving it a name, and optionally a brief description (what it does).
</p>
<p>
    These operations can be left as self-evident from their context, they can be given textual descriptions of the
    algorithm required to perform the behavior, or they could spawn off another whole pass of this technique where a set of
    classes that collaborate together to perform the internals of the operation are identified, etc.
</p>
<h4>
    Describe attributes and associations
</h4>
<p>
    A class may have to store simple data information, like: string, integer, and the like. For such simple type of
    information, attributes are defined for classes. For a more complex or "behavioral” attribute, consider creating an
    extra class and establish an association to it.
</p>
<p>
    To perform their responsibilities, classes may depend on other classes to supply needed behavior. These other classes
    might be ones already identified in this design session, they might be existing classes pulled from the architecture,
    or the need for new classes might be conceived. Associations in a class diagram can be used to represent inter-class
    relationships.
</p>
<p>
    <img height="439" alt="Login VOPC (Refined)" src="openup/guidances/guidelines/resources/login_vopc_refined.jpg" width="557" />
</p>
<p>
    This diagram shows a number of refinements. The LoginUI class has been replaced by LoginForm. The User class has been
    renamed UserCredentials and is created by the LoginForm class rather than LoginController. It is then used as a
    parameter for subsequent messages rather than passing the individual attributes. The SecuritySystemInterface class has
    been refined into two elements, ISystemSecurity, which provides a simple façade for interaction with the rests of the
    design; and SecuritySystemProxy, which handles interaction with the external security system.
</p>
<h3>
    Design internals
</h3>
<p>
    The classes in the design are likely to need to be distributed amongst different packages and subsystems or components.
</p>
<p>
    <img height="304" alt="User Login - Design Packages" src="openup/guidances/guidelines/resources/dv_Packaging.JPG" width="571" />
</p>
<p>
    In this example, the LoginForm, LoginController and UserCredentials elements have been placed in a package called
    LocalSecurity. The SecuritySystemProxy is a part of a subsystem called SecuritySystemAdapter which realizes the
    ISecuritySystem interface. The SecuritySystemAdapter wraps the legacy SecuritySystem, expressed here as a component
    offering a validateUser interface.
</p>
<p>
    Each of these packaged elements can be distributed amongst the team for further development work.
</p>
<h3>
    Conclusion
</h3>
<p>
    This guideline walked through the techniques in a concrete manner started with a scenario of a use case through to
    distributing the classes identified into a set of packages. This example demonstrates a technique for designing
    visually, but it should be considered as just one conceptual pass of design.&nbsp; One could as easily apply this
    technique when defining the internals of how the SecuritySystemProxy class will collaborate with a set of classes to
    validate the credentials.
</p>
<p>
    When applying this guideline, work in small chunks and keep in mind the goal of delivering software to the users that
    provides value. To deliver high-quality software requires consideration of how the pieces will work together to deliver
    that value. But as soon as key decisions have been made and the decisions have been communicated to the appropriate
    team members, the team should move on to implementing the source code to verify the design and deliver the value.

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Recommendation: Automated Code Unit&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The most appropriate technique for running these tests is using code that tests the components fully and that you can&#xD;
    run regularly as you update the system during development.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    When code is the&amp;nbsp;sole form of the tests, you must take care to ensure that the code is self-documenting, including&#xD;
    specifications of what conditions you are testing and what setup or clean-up is required for the test to run properly.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Option: Manual Instructions&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In some cases, manual instructions can suffice. For example, when testing a user interface, a Developer could walk&#xD;
    through a script, explaining the component. In this case, it can still be valuable to create a test harness that goes&#xD;
    straight to the user interface. That way, the Developer can follow the script without having to walk through a&#xD;
    complicated set of instructions to get to a particular screen or page.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Option: Embedded Code&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Certain technologies (such as Java&amp;trade; 5 Test Annotation) enable you to embed tests in the implementation. In those cases,&#xD;
    there will be a logical work product, but it will be assimilated into the code that you are testing. Here, too, take&#xD;
    into consideration that you must ensure that the code is self-documenting.&#xD;

            <MainDescription><![CDATA[<p>
    <b>Transforming</b> the design into code implements the system structure in the chosen source language. It also
    implements the system behavior defined in the functional requirements. <b>Implementing</b> the system behavior means
    writing the code that allows different parts of the application (classes or components) to collaborate in realizing the
    behavior of the system.
</p>
<p>
    There are various techniques for automatically transforming design to implementation. Here are some examples:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Standard patterns can be applied to generate design and code elements from related design and implementation. For
        example, a standard transformation pattern can be applied to a data table to create Java&trade; classes to access the
        data table. Another example is using an <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/emf/" target="_blank">Eclipse Modeling
        Framework</a> to generate code for storing data that matches the model and to generate a user interface
        implementation for populating data. A pattern or transformation engine can be used to create the implementation, or
        the implementation can be done by hand. Pattern engines are easier and more reliable, but handwritten code
        implementing a defined pattern will have fewer errors than handwritten code implementing a novel or unique design.
    </li>
    <li>
        Models can be detailed and used to generate an implementation. Both structure (class and package diagrams) and
        behavior diagrams (such as collaboration, state, and activity diagrams) can be used to generate executable code.
        These initial versions can be further refined as needed.
    </li>
    <li>
        The design may be platform-independent to varying degrees. Platform-specific design models or even code can be
        generated by transformations that apply various rules to map high-level abstractions of platform-specific elements.
        This is the focus of the Object Management Group (OMG) Model-Driven Architecture (MDA) <a
        href="http://www.omg.org/" target="_blank">(http://www.omg.org</a>) initiative.
    </li>
    <li>
        Platform-specific visual models can be used to generate an initial code framework. This framework can be further
        elaborated with additional code not specified in the design.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    In all cases, however, some design abstraction (classes, components, and so on) is detailed to become the
    implementation.

    Introduction
</h3>
<p>
    With Test-First Design (TFD) you do detailed design in a just-in-time (JIT) manner via writing a single test before
    writing just enough production code to fulfill that test. When you have new functionality to add to your system,
    perform the following steps:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <strong>Quickly add a developer test</strong>. You need just enough implementation code to fail.&nbsp; For example,
        a new method about to be added to a class could be created that just throws a fatal exception.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Run your tests</strong>. You will typically run the complete test suite, although for sake of speed you may
        decide to run only a subset. The goal is to ensure that the new test does in fact fail.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Update your production code</strong>. The goal is to add just enough functionality so that&nbsp;the code
        passes the new test.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Run your test suite again</strong>. If they tests fail you need to update your functional code and retest.
        Once the tests pass, start over.
    </li>
</ol><br />

</p>
<h4>
    Why TFD?
</h4>
<p>
    A significant advantage of TFD is that it enables you to take small steps when writing software, which is not only
    safer it is also far more productive than writing code in large steps. For example, assume you add some new functional
    code, compile, and test it. Chances are pretty good that your tests will be broken by defects that exist in the new
    code. It is much easier to find, and then fix, those defects if you''ve written five new lines of code than fifty lines.
    The implication is that the faster your compiler and regression test suite, the more attractive it is to proceed in
    smaller and smaller steps.
</p>
<p>
    There are other other common testing strategies (listed here in order of effectiveness).
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <strong>Write several tests first</strong>. This is a variant of TFD where you write more than one test before
        writing just enough production code to fulfill those tests. The advantage is that you don''t need to build your
        system as often, potentially saving time. It has the disadvantage that you will write more production code at once,
        increasing the difficulty of finding the cause of new bugs.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Test after the fact</strong>. With this approach you write some production code then you write enough
        testing code to validate it. This has the advantage that you''re at least still validating the code but has the
        disadvantage that you lose the design benefit inherent in writing the testing code first.
    </li>
</ol><br />
<h3>
    Good Things to Know
</h3>
<p>
    1. An underlying assumption of TFD is that a unit-testing framework is available. Agile software developers often use
    the xUnit family of open source tools, such as <a href="http://www.junit.org/"><strong>JUnit</strong></a> or <a
    href="http://www.vbunit.org/"><strong>VBUnit</strong></a>, although commercial tools are also viable options.
</p>
<p>
    2. Test-Driven Design (TDD) = TFD + <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../openup/guidances/concepts/refactoring.html"
    guid="_Poc7IPDzEdqYgerqi84oCA">Refactoring</a>
</p>
<p>
    3. TFD/TDD is commonly used with object-oriented business code, although this approach can be taken with procedural
    code, user-interface code, and database code.

    Usually, this task is focused on a specific element, such as a class or component, but it does not need to be.
</p>
<p>
    A portion of the design is implemented by performing this task. This task can be performed any number of times during
    an iteration. In fact it is best to do this task in as small a scope as possible to tighten the loop between it and
    related tasks involving developer testing and consideration of the design.

    If you are using sophisticated modeling tools, you should be able to generate a portion of the required source code&#xD;
    from the model. Note that programming is&amp;nbsp;commonly required to complete the implementation after the design model&#xD;
    has been transformed into code.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;

    Write the source code to make the implementation conform to the design and expected behavior. You should strive to&#xD;
    reuse and/or generate code wherever possible, but you will still need to do some programming. To do so, consider the&#xD;
    following:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Examine the&amp;nbsp;requirements. Because some requirements information does not translate directly into your design&#xD;
        you should examine the requirement(s) to ensure that they are fully realized in the implementation.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Refactor your code to improve its design. &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
        href=&quot;./../../openup/guidances/concepts/refactoring.html&quot; guid=&quot;_Poc7IPDzEdqYgerqi84oCA&quot;>Refactoring&lt;/a> is a&#xD;
        technique where you improve the quality of your code via small, safe changes.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Tune the results of the existing implementation by improving performance, the user interface, security, and other&#xD;
        nonfunctional areas.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Add missing details, such as completing the logic of operations or adding supporting classes and data structures&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Handle boundary conditions.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Deal with unusual circumstances or error states.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Restrict behavior (preventing users or client code from executing illegal flows, scenarios, or combinations of&#xD;
        options).&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Add critical sections for multi-threaded or re-entrant code.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Though many different considerations are listed here, there is one clear way to know when the source code is done. The&#xD;
    solution has been implemented when it passes the developer tests. Any other considerations can be taken care of in a&#xD;
    refactoring pass over the code to improve it once it is complete and correct.&#xD;

    Verify that the implementation is fit for its purpose. Examine the code for its suitability to perform its intended&#xD;
    function. This is a quality assurance step that you perform in addition to testing which is described in other tasks.&#xD;
    Consider these strategies:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Pair programming. By pairing to implement the code in the first place, you effectively evaluate the code as its&#xD;
        being written.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Read through the code for common mistakes. Consider keeping a checklist of common mistakes that you make, as a&#xD;
        reminder reference.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Use tools to check for implementation errors and inappropriate code. For example, use a static code rule checker or&#xD;
        set the compiler to the most detailed warning level.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Use tools that can visualize the code. Code visualization, such as the UML visualizations in the Eclipse IDE, help&#xD;
        developers identify issues such as excessive coupling or circular dependencies.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Perform informal, targeted code inspections. Ask colleagues to review small critical sections of code and code with&#xD;
        significant churn. Avoid reviewing large sections of code.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Use&amp;nbsp;a tester to ensure the implementation is testable and understandable to testing resources.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Improve the implementation based on the results of these evaluations.&#xD;

              <Description>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Communicate the impact of unexpected changes to the design and requirements.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The issues and constraints that you uncover when you implement the system must be communicated to the team. The impact&#xD;
    of issues discovered during implementation must be incorporated into future decisions. If appropriate, update&#xD;
    requirements to reflect ambiguities that you identified and resolved in the implementation so they can be tested and&#xD;
    you can manage the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../openup/roles/stakeholder.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;_dTa6gMAYEdqX-s4mWhkyqQ&quot;>Stakeholder&lt;/a> expectations appropriately. Similarly, update the design to reflect new&#xD;
    constraints and issues uncovered during implementation to be sure that the new information is communicated to other&#xD;
    developers.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Usually, there is no need for a change request if the required change is small and the same person is designing and&#xD;

    Developer testing is different from other forms of testing in that it is based on the expected behavior of code units
    rather than being directly based on the system requirements.
</p>
<p>
    It is best to do this at a small scale, much smaller than the complete code base to be authored by a developer over the
    course of an iteration. This can be done for one operation, one field added to a user interface, one stored procedure,

    It is important that the author of this work product be able to analyze key decisions about the structure and behavior&#xD;
    of the system and communicate them to other collaborators. It is also important that these decisions can be&#xD;
    communicated at various levels of abstraction and granularity. Some aspects of the design can be represented by source&#xD;
    code, possibly with some extra annotations. But more abstract representations of the design will be at a higher-level&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The more abstract representation could use various representation options. UML could be used either strictly or&#xD;
    informally; it is a preferred notation based on its rich semantics and broad usage in the industry. Other techniques&#xD;
    could be used to communicate the design. Or the design could use a mix of techniques as applicable.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Whether you record these representations on a white board or use a formal tool is not governed by this process. But any&#xD;

    This task is about designing part of the system, not the whole system. It should be applied based upon some small
    subset of the requirements. The requirements driving the <a class="elementLink"
    href="./../../openup/workproducts/design.html" guid="_0WuL8slgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">Design</a> could be scenario-based
    functional requirements, non-functional requirements, or a combination.
</p>
<p>
    This task can be applied in some specific context such as the database access elements required for some scenario. In
    this case the task might be applied again later to deal with a different context on the same requirements. Keep in mind
    that to actually build some functionality of value to the users, all contexts will typically need to be designed and
    implemented. For example, to complete a piece of system capability it must be designed and implemented in all its
    contexts including the user interface, business rules, database access, etc.
</p>
<p>
    For cohesion and completeness, this task is described as an end-to-end pass of designing a scenario of system usage. In
    practice, this task will be revisited many times as the design is first considered, portions are implemented, more
    design is performed based on what was learned, etc. The healthiest application of this task is in very close proximity
    to the implementation.
</p>

    referenced by the <a class="elementLink" href="./../../openup/workproducts/architecture_notebook.html"

    Each step in this task can cause all previous steps to be revisited in light of new information and decisions.&nbsp;For




    example, while determining how elements collaborate&nbsp;you might find a gap in the requirements that cause you to go




    back to the beginning after collaborating with the&nbsp;<a class="elementLink" href="./../../openup/roles/analyst_39D7C49B.html" guid="_0VxJsMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">Analyst</a>. Or when evaluating the

    new elements to take its place.




</p>




<p>




    Consider the architecture while performing this task.&nbsp;All design work must be done while regarding the




    architecture within which the Design exists.&nbsp;Furthermore, certain design elements will be deemed architecturally




    significant; those elements will require updates to the architecture.




</p>




<p>




    This task will be applied numerous times.&nbsp;Design is best performed in small chunks.




</p>




<p>




    Even when starting the design for a particular project it&nbsp;is expected that there will be existing frameworks and




    reusable elements.&nbsp;Every step of this task must give attention to the existing Design and existing&nbsp;<a class="elementLink" href="./../../openup/workproducts/implementation_917CA61E.html" guid="_0YoQcMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">Implementation</a>, utilizing existing elements when possible and emulating or improving

    Apply patterns throughout this task.&nbsp;Patterns represent proven designs and their usage promotes quality and

    Walk through the scenario distributing responsibilities to the participating elements and ensuring that the elements&#xD;
    have the relationships required to collaborate.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    These responsibilities can be simple statements of behavior assigned to elements; they need not be detailed operation&#xD;
    specifications with parameters, etc. Similarly, the relationships can just be defined at this step. This step is about&#xD;
    ensuring that a quality model is being created that is robust enough to support the requirements.

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Look to the Architecture Notebook and previous design work to create a consistent collaboration. Work with the&#xD;
    architect to understand the details and motivations of the architecture. Look to reuse existing behavior and relations&#xD;

    Refine the design to an appropriate level of detail to drive implementation and to ensure that it fits into the&#xD;

&#xD;
    technical decisions. Revisit the identification of the elements and the collaborations that realize the scenarios if&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
    necessary as this refinement takes into consideration details at a lower level of abstraction. Discuss testability&#xD;

    Communicate&amp;nbsp;the system''s design to&amp;nbsp;those who need to understand it. Though this is described here toward the&#xD;
    end of the task, communication should be going on throughout the steps. Working collaboratively is always better than&#xD;
    reviewing the work after it is complete.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Here are some ways to communicate&amp;nbsp;the design:&#xD;

&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Formal models&amp;nbsp;specified in UML.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Informal diagrams that render static structure and capture&amp;nbsp;dynamic behavior.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Annotated code that communicates information about the static structure. This can be&amp;nbsp;supplemented with textual&#xD;
        descriptions of collaborative behavior across code modules.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Data models to describe the database schema.&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    Here are some examples of individuals&amp;nbsp;who will need to understand the design of the system:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Developers&amp;nbsp;who will implement a solution based on the design.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Architects who can review the design to ensure that it conforms to the architecture or who might examine the design&#xD;
        for opportunities to improve the architecture.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Other designers who can examine the design for applicability to other parts of the system.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Developers or other designers who will be working on other parts of the system that will&amp;nbsp;depend on the&#xD;

            <MainDescription><![CDATA[<p>
    When identifying the elements for a scenario of system behavior, you can align each participating element with one of
    three key perspectives: <b>Entity</b>, <b>Control</b>, or <b>Boundary</b>. Although specifics of languages, frameworks,
    and heuristics of quality design will drive the final design, a first cut that covers required system behavior can
    always be assembled with elements of these three perspectives.
</p>
<p>
    This pattern is similar to the Model View Controller pattern (described here [<a class="elementLinkWithUserText"
    href="./../../../openup/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.html#BUS96" guid="_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg">BUS96</a>]
    and here [<a class="elementLinkWithUserText"
    href="./../../../openup/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.html#WIKP-MVC"
    guid="_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg">WIKP-MVC</a>], among other places), but the Entity Control Boundary (ECB) pattern is not
    solely appropriate for dealing with user interfaces, and it gives the controller a slightly different role to play.
</p>
<h4 align="left">

</p>
<h1>
    Entity elements
</h1>
<p>
    An entity is a long-lived, passive element that is responsible for some meaningful chunk of information. This is not to
    say that entities are "data," while other design elements are "function." Entities perform behavior organized around
    some cohesive amount of data.
</p>
<p>
    An example of an entity for a customer service application is a Customer entity that manages all information about a
    customer. A design element for&nbsp;this entity would include data about the customer, behavior to manage the data,
    behavior to validate customer information&nbsp;and to perform other business calculations, such as "Is this customer
    allowed to purchase product X?"
</p>
<p>
    The identification of the entities as part of this pattern can be done many times at different levels of abstraction
    from the code, at different levels of granularity in size, and from the perspectives of different contexts. For
    example, you could do an analysis pass on a scenario of creating a marketing campaign and identify the customer element
    with various customer data elements, such as name and address, plus various required behaviors, such as the management
    of the name and address data and the ability to rate the customer based on some algorithm (such an application of this
    pattern would be abstract from code, coarse-grained, and have no specific context). Later, you could do a pass on the
    same scenario applying an architectural mechanism for database access that breaks the address out as its own element,
    moves the responsibility for storing and retrieving customers to a new control element, and identifies specific
    database decisions, such as the use of primary keys in the entities. (Such an application of this pattern would be
    closer to the code, finer-grained, and aligned with a database&nbsp;context.)
</p>
<h1>
    Control elements
</h1>
<p>
    A control element manages the flow of interaction of the scenario. A control element could manage the end-to-end
    behavior of a scenario. or it could manage the interactions between a subset of the elements. Behavior and business
    rules relating to the information relevant to the scenario should be assigned to the entities; the control elements are
    responsible only for the flow of the scenario.
</p>
<p>
    CreateMarketingCapmpaign is an example of a control element for a customer service application. This design element
    would&nbsp;be responsive to certain frontend boundary elements and would collaborate with other entities,
    control&nbsp;elements, and backend boundary elements to support the creation of a marketing campaign.
</p>
<p>
    As with the entity example here, there might be many passes over the identification of control elements. A first pass
    might be an analysis pass that identifies one control element for a scenario, with behavior to make sure that the
    design can support the flow of events. A&nbsp;subsequent pass might find controllers to manage reusable collaborations
    of low-level elements that will map to a specific code&nbsp;unit to be written.
</p>
<h1>
    Boundary elements
</h1>
<p>
    A boundary element lies on the periphery of a system or subsystem, but within it. For any scenario being considered
    either across the whole system or within some subsystem, some boundary elements will be "front end" elements that
    accept input from outside of the area under design, and other elements will be "back end," managing communication to
    supporting elements outside of the system or subsystem.
</p>
<p>
    Two examples of boundary elements for a customer service application might be a front end MarketingCampaignForm and a
    back end BugdetSystem element. The MarketingCampaignForm would manage the exchange of information between a user and
    the system, and the BugdetSystem would manage the exchange of information between the system and an external system
    that manages budgets.
</p>
<p>
    An analysis pass could identify one boundary element for each external relevant to a scenario. Subsequently, these
    could be broken down into multiple boundary elements or small communities made up of collaborating elements of all
    three stereotypes.
</p>
<h1>
    Walking through the scenario
</h1>
<p>
    You can walk through a scenario initiated by something outside of the boundaries of the system or subsystem being
    designed and distribute the responsibility to perform behavior supporting the scenario to the elements identified of
    each type. The appropriate design element responsible for each action in the scenario will be as described in the
    definition of each of the element types described here previously.
</p>
<p>
    In addition to identifying the behavior necessary to perform the scenario, the initiation of this behavior from design
    element to design element identifies the necessary relationships. There are certain appropriate relations between the
    participating elements. An element can communicate with other elements of the same kind. Control elements can
    communicate with each of the other two kinds, but entities and boundary elements should not communicate directly.
</p>
<p>
    This table shows appropriate links between design elements.

            <MainDescription><![CDATA[<p>
    Refactoring is a disciplined way to restructure code when small changes are made to the code to improve its design. An
    important aspect of a refactoring is that it improves the design while not changing the behavior of the design; a
    refactoring neither adds nor removes functionality.
</p>
<p>
    Refactoring enables you to evolve the code slowly over time, to take an iterative and incremental approach to
    implementation.
</p>
<p>
    These are the types of refactoring:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Code refactoring. Often referred to simply as refactoring, this is the refactoring of programming source code.
        Examples of code refactorings include Rename Method, Encapsulate Field, Extract Class, Introduce Assertion, and
        Pushdown Method.
    </li>
    <li>
        Database refactoring. A database refactoring is a simple change to a database schema that improves its design while
        retaining both its behavioral and informational semantics. Examples of database refactorings include Rename Column,
        Split Table, Move Method to Database, Replace LOB with Table, Introduce Column Constraint, and Use Official Data
        Source.
    </li>
    <li>
        User interface (UI) refactoring. A UI refactoring is a simple change to the UI which retains its semantics.
        Examples of UI refactorings include Align Entry Fields, Apply Common Button Size, Apply Common Font, Indicate
        Format, Reword in Active Voice, and Increase Color Contrast.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    Martin Fowler [<a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../openup/guidances/supportingmaterials/references_6CCF393.html#FOW99" guid="_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg">FOW99</a>] identifies four key reasons to refactor:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Refactoring improves the design of software
    </li>
    <li>
        Refactoring makes software easier to understand
    </li>
    <li>
        Refactoring helps you find bugs
    </li>
    <li>
        Refactoring helps you program faster
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Refactoring can improve the design of existing code, but it does not take the place of considering the design before
    writing code. Refactoring instead changes the role of up-front design, allowing the strictly design work to be more
    abstract. Small-scale, very tactical decisions can be made during the implementation of the solution with confidence
    that refactoring will ensure a quality implementation at that level. The designing of the solution before
    implementation will be more lightweight and focused on broad factors that will drive the implementation.
</p>
<p>
    There is an additional benefit of refactoring: it changes the way a developer thinks about the implementation when not
    refactoring. The basic task of implementing a solution becomes solely about getting the solution to pass its developer
    tests in the simplest way possible. Then the design of that solution can be examined and refactored separately. Even if
    these two things -- implementation of the solution and then improvement -- are just a minute apart, it can be freeing
    for a developer to single-mindedly create code that causes a test to pass, and then separately single-mindedly improve
    that code.

            <MainDescription><![CDATA[<p>
    This guideline describes a number of types of tests. To perform these types of testing you need to define, and then
    run, a series of tests against the source code. A developer test is a single test that needs to be performed.
</p>
<p>
    It is valuable&nbsp;to augment automated tests with human readable test scripts in order to implement developer test
    cases, scripts that include the information discussed below. A test script is the actual steps, sometimes either
    written procedures to follow or the source code of a test. Developer test scripts are run against testing targets:
    either one unit of source code, a more complex portion of your system (such as a component), or the entire system
    itself to test&nbsp;some developer issue such as integration.
</p>
<h3>
    Regression Testing
</h3>
<p>
    Regression testing is the act of ensuring that changes to&nbsp;the code have not adversely affected existing
    functionality. It is important to recognize that incremental development makes regression testing critical. Whenever
    you release an application, you must ensure its previous functionality still works, and because you release
    applications more often when taking the incremental approach, this means regression testing becomes that much more
    important. Regression testing is the first thing you should be thinking about when testing for the following reasons:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        You want to be able to modify code and know that you can rerun your tests to see if you broke anything.
    </li>
    <li>
        Existing users get very angry when things that previously worked don’t work anymore.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    Regression testing is fairly straightforward conceptually – you just need to run all of the previous test cases against
    the new version of the code. Regression testing tools help immensely because they are designed with regression testing
    in mind. However, there are potential challenges to regression testing:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        When you change your production, either to enhance it or to refactor it, you will need to rework existing test
        cases coupled to that code.
    </li>
    <li>
        If your updates affect only a component of the system, then potentially you only need to run the test cases that
        affect this single component. Although this approach is a little risky because your changes may have had a greater
        impact than you suspect, it does help to reduce both the time and cost of regression testing.
    </li>
    <li>
        The more non-code artifacts that you decide to keep, the greater the effort to regression test your work and
        therefore the greater the risk to your project because you are more likely to skimp on your testing efforts.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Regression testing is critical to success as an agile developer. Many software developers use the xUnit family of open
    source tools, such as <a href="http://www.junit.org/" target="_blank">JUnit</a> and <a href="http://www.vbunit.org/" target="_blank">VBUnit</a>, to test their code. The advantage of these tools is that they implement a testing framework
    with which you can regression test all of your source code. Commercial testing tools are also viable options.
</p>
<h3>
    Traditional Code Testing Techniques
</h3>
<p>
    Although object and procedural technologies are different, several important testing concepts from the procedural world
    are valid regardless of the underlying technology. These traditional testing techniques are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Black-box testing
    </li>
    <li>
        Clear-box testing
    </li>
    <li>
        Boundary-value testing
    </li>
    <li>
        Coverage/Path testing
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    Black-Box Testing
</h4>
<p>
    Black-box testing, also called interface testing, is a technique in which you create test cases based only on the
    expected functionality of a method, class, or application without any knowledge of its internal workings. One way to
    define black-box testing is that given input A you should obtain expected results B.
</p>
<p>
    The goal of black-box testing is to ensure the system can do what it should be able to do, but not how it does it. For
    example, if you invoke differenceInDays(June 30 2006, July 3 2006) the expected result should be three. The creation of
    black-box tests is often driven by the requirements for&nbsp;the system. The basic idea is&nbsp;to look at the user
    requirement and ask what needs to be done to show that the user requirement is met.
</p>
<p>
    The primary advantage of black-box testing is that it enables you to prove that your application fulfills the
    requirements defined for it.&nbsp;&nbsp; The primary disadvantage is that it does not show that the internals
    of&nbsp;the system work (hence the need for clear-box testing).
</p>
<h4>
    Clear-Box Testing
</h4>
<p>
    Clear-box testing, also called white-box testing, is based on the idea that&nbsp;the program code can drive the
    development of test cases. The basic concept is you look at&nbsp;the code, and then create test cases that exercise it.
    For example, assume you have access to the source code for differenceInDays(). When you look at it, you see an IF
    statement determines whether the two dates are in the same year. If they are in the same year then&nbsp;a simple
    strategy based on Julian dates is used; if not then a more complex&nbsp;strategy is used. This indicates that you need
    at least one test that uses dates from the same year and one from different years. By looking at the code, you are able
    to determine new test cases to exercise the different logic paths within it.
</p>
<p>
    The primary advantage of this concept is that it motivates you to create tests that exercise specific lines of
    code.&nbsp; The disadvantages are that it does not ensure that your code fulfils the actual requirements (hence the
    need for black-box testing) and that your testing code becomes highly coupled to your application code.
</p>
<h4>
    Boundary-Value Testing
</h4>
<p>
    This is based on the knowledge that you need to test your code to ensure it can handle unusual and extreme situations.
    For example, boundary-value test cases differenceInDays() would include passing it the same date, two wildly different
    dates, one date on the last day of the year and the second on the first day of the following year, and one date on
    February 29th of a leap year. The basic idea is you want to look for limits defined either by your business rules or by
    common sense, and then create test cases to test attribute values in and around those values.
</p>
<p>
    The primary advantage of boundary value testing is that it motivates you to confirm that your program code is able to
    handle “unusual” or “extreme” cases.
</p>
<h4>
    Coverage and Path Testing
</h4>
<p>
    Two critical “traditional” concepts are coverage and path testing. Coverage testing is a technique in which you create
    a series of test cases designed to test all the code paths in your code. In many ways, coverage testing is simply a
    collection of clear-box test cases that together exercise every line of code in your application at least once. Path
    testing is a superset of coverage testing that ensures not only have all lines of code been tested, but all paths of
    logic have also been tested. The main difference occurs when you have a method with more than one set of case
    statements or nested IF statements: to determine the number of test cases with coverage testing you would count the
    maximum number of paths between the sets of case/nested IF statements and, with path testing, you would multiply the
    number of logic paths.
</p>
<h4>
    Unit and Integration Testing
</h4>
<p>
    Unit testing is the testing of an item, such as an operation, in isolation. For example, the tests defined so far for
    differenceInDays() are all unit tests. Integration testing, on the other hand, is the testing of a collection of items
    to validate that they work together. In the case of the data library/class, do the various functions work together?
    Perhaps the differenceInDays() function has a side effect that causes the dayOfWeek() function to fail if
    differenceInDays() is called first. Integration testing looks for problems like this.
</p>
<h3>
    Object-Oriented Testing Techniques
</h3>
<p>
    When testing systems built using object technology it is important to understand that your source code is composed of
    several constructs, including methods (operations), classes, and inheritance. Therefore you need testing techniques
    that reflect the fact that you have these constructs. These techniques are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Method testing
    </li>
    <li>
        Class testing
    </li>
    <li>
        Class-integration testing
    </li>
    <li>
        Inheritance-regression testing
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    Method Testing
</h4>
<p>
    Method testing is the act of ensuring that your methods (operations) perform as defined. In procedural testing this
    would have been called function/procedure testing. Issues to address via method testing include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Ensure that your getter/setter methods work as intended
    </li>
    <li>
        Ensure that each method returns the proper values, including error messages and exceptions
    </li>
    <li>
        Validate the parameters being passed to a method
    </li>
    <li>
        Ensure that a method does what it should
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The advantage of method testing is that it ensures that methods work well in isolation but it does not help to find
    unintended side effects.
</p>
<h4>
    Class Testing
</h4>
<p>
    The main purpose of class testing is to test classes in isolation, and it is effectively the combination of traditional
    unit testing and integration testing. It is unit testing because you are testing the class and its instances as single
    units in isolation, but it is also integration testing because you need to verify the methods and attributes of the
    class work together. The one assumption you need to make while writing “class tests” is that all other classes in the
    system work. Issues to address via class testing include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Validate that the attributes of an object are initialized properly
    </li>
    <li>
        Validate the invariants of the class
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The primary advantages of class testing are that it validates that the operations and properties of a class work
    together and that the class works in isolation. However, it does not guarantee that a class works well with the rest of
    your system.
</p>
<h4>
    Class-integration Testing
</h4>
<p>
    Also known as component testing, this technique addresses the issue of whether the classes in your system, or a
    component of your system, work together properly. The relationships between classes can be used to drive the
    development of class integration test cases. Issues to address via class-integration testing include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Validate that objects do what other objects expect of them
    </li>
    <li>
        Validate that return values are acted appropriately
    </li>
    <li>
        Validate that exceptions/errors are processed appropriately
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The technique helps to validate that the various classes within a component, or a system, work together. However, it
    can be difficult to define and develop the test cases to fully perform this level of testing.
</p>
<h4>
    Inheritance-regression Testing
</h4>This is the act of running of test cases defined for the superclasses on the instances of a subclass because errors
have not been introduced by that new subclass. New methods are added and existing methods may be redefined by subclasses,
methods which access and potentially change the value of the attributes defined in the superclass. It is possible that a
subclass may change the value of the attributes in a way that was never intended in the superclass, or at least was never
expected. The point is that you need to invoke the test suite of the superclass(es) when testing a subclass. <br />]]></MainDescription>

            <MainDescription><![CDATA[<p>
    Developer testing is the act of regression testing source code by developers. This is sometimes called "unit regression
    testing" but many developer tests go beyond unit testing to address integration testing as well.
</p>
<h3>
    Testing Philosophies
</h3>
<p>
    Here are some important philosophies with regard to developer testing:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        The goal is to find defects. Successful tests find bugs, but correcting the bugs falls into other areas.
    </li>
    <li>
        Test early and often. The cost of change rises exponentially the longer it takes to find and then remove a defect.
        The implication is that you want to test as early as possible (the earliest you could possibly test is first, see
        <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../../openup/guidances/guidelines/test_first_design_21C77ADF.html" guid="_0Y6kUMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">Guideline: Test-first Design</a>).
    </li>
    <li>
        Testing builds confidence. Many people fear making a change to their code because they are afraid that they will
        break it, but with a full test suite in place if you do break something you know you will detect it and then fix
        it.
    </li>
    <li>
        One test is worth a thousand opinions. You can say that your application works, but until you show the test results
        you might not be believed.
    </li>
    <li>
        Test to the risk. The riskier something is, the more it needs to be reviewed and tested. In other words you should
        invest significant effort testing in the algorithm for estimating radiation doses but nowhere near as much effort
        testing the "change font size" function of the same application.
    </li>
    <li>
        You can validate all artifacts. You can test all your artifacts, not just your source code, although the focus of
        this guidance is testing code.
    </li>
</ol>
<h3>
    Qualities of a Good Developer Test
</h3>These are the qualities of a good developer test: 
<ul class="noindent">
    <li>
        It runs fast. It has short setup, run time, and clean-up.
    </li>
    <li>
        It runs in isolation. You should be able to reorder your tests.
    </li>
    <li>
        It is understandable. Good tests have consistent and informative names and use data that makes them easy to read
        and to understand.
    </li>
    <li>
        It uses real data. For example, use copies of production data when appropriate, but remember that you''ll typically
        have to create some specific "artificial" test data as well.
    </li>
    <li>
        It is minimally cohesive. The test represents one step toward your overall goal. The test should address one and
        one only issue.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    Approaches for Test Setup
</h3>
<p>
    To successfully run a test, the system must be in a known state. To do this you will need objects or components in
    memory, rows in the database, etc. that you will test against. The easiest approach is to hardcode the required data
    and the setup code within the test itself. The primary advantage is that all the information that you need about the
    test is in one place and that the test is potentially self-sufficient.
</p>
<p>
    Another approach is to define an external data set which is loaded into memory or into the database at the beginning of
    the test run. There are several advantages to this approach:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        It decouples the test data from the test.
    </li>
    <li>
        More than one test can use the same data set.
    </li>
    <li>
        It is easy to modify and/or multiply the test data.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    There are some disadvantages to this approach:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Increased complexity for maintaining the external data
    </li>
    <li>
        Potential coupling between test cases. When they share a common test data bed it becomes very easy to write tests
        that depend on other tests running first, thereby coupling them together.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    Coding for Testability
</h3>
<p>
    Add <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../openup/guidances/termdefinitions/code_instrumentation_E6BE9793.html" guid="_JiqnEJt1EdutoZjlV3a4Lg">code instrumentation</a> for testing and debugging. Pay special attention to the
    implementation of the observation/control points, such as critical functions or objects, as these aspects might need
    special support that has to be implemented in the component under test.
</p>
<h3>
    Reviewing Tests
</h3>
<p>
    If a test will be long-lived, ask a person with less inside knowledge of the component to run it and check if there is
    enough support information. Review it with other people within the development team and other interested parties as
    needed.

            <MainDescription><![CDATA[<p>
    Using a coding standard is a widely accepted software development practice. The need for this practice takes on added
    importance in a highly collaborative environment. The team should have a standard way of naming and formatting things
    so they can understand the code quickly and know where to look at all times. This enables shared code ownership since
    any team member should be able to quickly understand the code written by others.
</p>
<p>
    Ideally, the coding standard should be the result of team consensus. Involving the team members will aid adoption of
    the standards.
</p>
<p>
    Coding Standards cover such areas as:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Naming standards. This includes the naming of elements all the way down to the smallest variable. In covering
        larger-scale elements, this overlaps into what could be considered design standards.
    </li>
    <li>
        File organization. This includes file naming conventions and how the files will be organized on the file system.
    </li>
    <li>
        Comment standards. Too much emphasis on comments implies a lack of confidence that readable code is being written,
        plus there is always a concern that the comments are not up to date. Yet, a consistent approach to comments
        improves understandability and can support the ability to generate documentation from the code.
    </li>
    <li>
        Coding conventions. Consistent application of specific code-level conventions and the exclusion of some considered
        poor form improve the quality of the code.
    </li>
    <li>
        White space. Though it can be argued to be less critical than the other items listed here, a consistent usage of
        white space as indentation and blank lines also improves readability.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    In some cases, decisions will be arbitrary (like how much to indent). Each item in the standard should support one or
    more goals, improved communication being one of the most critical goals. Once the team agrees on a standard, all
    members of the teams are expected to follow it. With time, the team will use and modify the standard to develop a style
    that is well adapted to the environment.
</p>
<p>
    Though some standards can transcend any language, coding standards must be language specific for the most part.
</p>
<p>
    For example coding standards, see the <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/codeconv/html/CodeConvTOC.doc.html" target="_blank">Code Conventions for the JavaTM Programming Language</a> or these <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/brada/articles/361363.aspx" target="_blank">Internal Coding Guidelines</a> for .NET
    development.

    The items in this checklist represent good practices for creating a high-quality implementation. Try to address every
    item to the greatest extent possible to create the best implementation. It may not be possible to address every item,
    and you may be able to address some items to only a limited extent. In these cases, be sure that there are good reasons
    for only partially addressing an item or not addressing an item at all.
</p>
<p>
    This checklist is not something that should be considered only for heavyweight code reviews. Each developer should keep
    the quality criteria embodied in these check items in mind while coding. When developers work together, the review
    against these criteria should be done in real time so that quality is ensured up front as they are writing the code.
</p>
<p>
    Appropriate divergence from the quality criteria described here could be worthy of a comment in the implementation so
    that developers examining the code in the future know why the exception occurred.

            <MainDescription><![CDATA[<p>
    Refactoring involves improving the design of existing code without changing the system''s behavior. It is explicitly not
    about adding or changing behavior, but about improving the design of existing behavior.
</p>
<p>
    A full set of developer tests is required before refactoring can be safely applied. It is critical that the system
    behavior be in a known, verifiably correct state before modifying the design so that you can improve the design without
    fear that the modified implementation will break something. Refactoring is a safe transformation to improve code, but
    it is safe only if there are tests that can verify that the system still works as intended.
</p>
<p>
    Refactoring is initiated when an area that needs improvement is identified in the system by examining either the code
    or&nbsp;some other&nbsp;representation of the design. The issues identified are sometimes called "smells."
</p>
<p>
    Here are several smells to look for that might lead to refactoring:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Duplicated code:</b> Duplicated code makes the system harder to understand and harder to maintain.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Large design element or method:</b> Large design elements or methods diminish the ability of people to
        understand the design, reduce the potential for reuse, and make developer testing more difficult.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Poorly named element:</b> Whether the element be a variable, function, class, or component, its name should
        connote what it is so that the code can be maintained.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Tight coupling:</b> Each design element should work with minimal concern for the internal aspects of other
        design elements. Otherwise, changes to one element can have undesirable effects in other elements.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    As you can see from this list, refactoring can improve the "internals" of a design element, the interface of the
    element, or the relationships and collaboration between elements. Also, many of the smells&nbsp;are characterized as
    making the software more difficult to understand; whereas refactoring is about making the system simpler.
</p>
<p>
    After an issue is identified, a refactoring method can be selected that will improve the situation. There are catalogs
    of refactoring methods available that are change patterns that will fix common problems while retaining the behavior of
    the system.
</p>
<p>
    These are examples of refactoring methods:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Extract Method:</b> Pull out the duplicated code into its own single method or extract part of a large method
        into its own method.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Extract Class:</b> Pull some cohesive part of a class into its own class to reduce the size of a design element
        that is too big.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Rename Method</b>, <b>Rename Class</b>, or <b>Rename Variable:</b> Give a more meaningful name to an element to
        make it more understandable.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Extract Interface:</b> Create a clean interface to an element to reduce coupling.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    When refactoring has been applied, developer tests are run again to ensure that the system still behaves correctly. It
    is important that the system is working correctly after each small refactoring. Although many refactorings can be put
    together to drive broad change across the code base, the tests should run correctly between each refactoring applied.
    Refactoring must be applied as small behavior-preserving transformations.
</p>
<p>
    As mentioned previously, refactoring requires full developer test coverage of the area under consideration. There are
    additional techniques that enable refactoring. Coding standards define a common style and make it easier to refactor
    consistently. An attitude of&nbsp;collective code ownership within the team is important. Each developer should feel
    that refactoring can be applied across the code base to improve the implementation.
</p>

            <MainDescription><![CDATA[<p>
    Maximizing reuse has always been an important goal of software development. It''s better to re-use existing code and
    design than to expend the cost of creating something new, testing it, and releasing it for the first time with the risk
    of hidden problems that all new software has. Languages, particularly object-oriented ones, have been developed to make
    reuse easier. But a language alone isn''t enough to provide cost effective reuse. The bulk of reusable software comes
    from skilled developers and architects who are able to identify and leverage reuse opportunities.
</p>
<p>
    There are three perspectives to look at when reusing software: code (implementation), design, and framework or
    architecture. Architects should look to reuse significant application frameworks such as layers that can be applied to
    many different types of applications. Developers should look to designs and patterns that can be reused to produce
    desired behavior or robust structures. They should also look at how to reduce the amount of code that needs to be
    written by leveraging stable components and code that has been proven in production environments.
</p>
<h4>
    Identifying Reuse Opportunities
</h4>
<p>
    The best way to enable a team to find opportunities for reuse is to exercise excellent design and coding practices.
    It''s difficult to find code and design that can be reused when dealing with large classes, classes that don''t have a
    clearly defined focus, or classes with relationships that are difficult to understand. Classes should be small, easy to
    understand, and highly cohesive to make it easier to identify reuse opportunities. Any functionality that can be
    reasonably separated into another class should be. Another way of saying this is that any concept that could be applied
    to more than one type of class should be its own class.
</p>
<p>
    For example, if some calculations are added to an existing class, it may make sense to then refactor those calculations
    into a new helper class. Those calculations can&nbsp;then be re-used in any number of other classes without the burden
    of having to know about the functionality of the original class.
</p>
<p>
    The simplest but least efficient way to identify reuse opportunities is to "smell" similar code. A developer may recall
    doing something similar to what they''re designing or implementing now. Once the previous implementation has been
    discovered or recalled it can be reused. Developers will always find reuse opportunities this way. But the unstructured
    nature of it won''t maximize the potential areas for reuse.
</p>
<p>
    Collaboration is a good technique for identifying reuse opportunities. It provides a structure where identifying reuse
    - instead of writing code - is the goal of the exercise. And the more brains that are looking for reuse opportunities,
    the more likely it is that they''ll be found. A brainstorming or review meeting that focuses on identifying reuse
    opportunities would be useful to support this.
</p>
<p>
    Patterns are good ways to find reuse opportunities in designs and frameworks. See <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../../openup/guidances/concepts/pattern_10BE6D96.html" guid="_0YJvUMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">Concept: Pattern</a>&nbsp;for more information.
</p>
<p>
    Analyzing behavior is another good way to identify potential areas for reuse. Analyze how classes need to collaborate
    in order to deliver some specific functionality such as a requirement or feature. This collaboration can be documented
    in sequence (behavior) and class (structure) diagrams and can be reused in similar circumstances.
</p>
<p>
    <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../openup/guidances/concepts/refactoring_1B63BA3B.html" guid="_Poc7IPDzEdqYgerqi84oCA">Refactoring</a> should always be considered when reusing code. Code (or design) is often
    not originally written for re-use, or reusable code may not be a perfect fit for a new situation.
</p>
<h4>
    Reuse Techniques
</h4>
<p>
    Reuse can be performed differently depending on the capabilities of the implementation environment. The simplest
    technique is to copy the code from one place to another. This isn''t advisable because it''s not really reuse. Multiple
    copies of source code are difficult to maintain and can eventually diverge from each other. Reuse is about using the
    same code to perform similar tasks as a way to increase quality and reduce overhead.
</p>
<p>
    Some languages, such as C++, support templates. Templates, sometimes referred to as parameterized code, are a precursor
    to patterns. Templates are code with parameters that are applied just when the code''s needed, at compile time. The C++
    Standard Template Library (STL) is one example. It provides many types of reusable containers (lists, sets, safe
    arrays, etc) that don''t have some of the drawbacks of inheritance. Templates such as these are also useful as mix-in
    classes in languages like C++ that support multiple inheritance. Because mix-ins are implemented as templates, they
    allow for a type of multiple inheritance without the baggage.
</p>
<h4>
    Inheritance and Aggregation
</h4>
<p>
    Inheritance (also known as generalization) is an easy way to implement polymorphism and has been used as the primary
    mechanism for reuse in modern object-oriented languages. This is unfortunate, as inheritance imposes a rigid structure
    on the software''s design that is difficult to change. Any inheritance hierarchy that shares code from parents to
    children will have problems when it grows to be three or more levels deep. Too many exceptions occur to maintain a pure
    "is-a" relationship between parents and children, where children are always considered to have all the properties and
    behaviors of the parents. Inheritance should be used to share definitions (interfaces), not implementations. Years of
    difficulties with inheriting implementations have made this practice a primary object-oriented design principle.
</p>
<p>
    Whenever inheritance is used, it is best to have only the last child class (leaf node) of the inheritance hierarchy be
    instantiated. All parent classes should be abstract. This is because a class that tries to be both reusable and
    concrete - to provide reusable and specific behavior at the same time - almost always fails to fulfill either goal.
    This is a dimension of cohesiveness. One thing that makes a class cohesive is that it''s dedicated to reuse or dedicated
    to a specific implementation, but not both.
</p>
<p>
    Aggregation is a technique that collects or aggregates functionality into larger elements of functionality. It provides
    a structure that''s far more flexible and reusable than inheritance. It''s better to reuse implementation and design by
    aggregating small pieces of functionality together rather than trying to inherit the functionality from a parent.
</p>
<p>
    You may also find reuse opportunities by reviewing interfaces. If interfaces describe similar behavior it may be
    possible to eliminate one of the interfaces, have just one implementation realize both interfaces, or refactor the
    interfaces to put redundant content in a new, simpler interface.
</p>
<h4>
    Finding Reusable Code
</h4>
<p>
    There are many sources of reusable code beyond what the developers are writing for a specific project. Other places
    from which to harvest code include the following:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Internal (corporate) code libraries
    </li>
    <li>
        Third party libraries
    </li>
    <li>
        Built-in language libraries
    </li>
    <li>
        Code samples from tutorials, examples, books, etc.
    </li>
    <li>
        Local code guru or knowledgeable colleague
    </li>
    <li>
        Existing system code
    </li>
    <li>
        Open source products (be sure to follow any licensing agreements)
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Also, many tools that generate code will generate comprehensive code based on minimal specification. For example, a
    design tool might generate the member variable plus a get and a set operation when the designer specifies an attribute.
    Other more sophisticated tools with knowledge of a specific framework can generate voluminous code to ensure that a
    class conforms to the framework. An example of this would be a tool that generates significant additional code when a
    class is marked as a Java entity bean. This sort of consistent transformation from a specification (the design) to an
    implementation (the code) could be considered a form of code reuse as well.
</p>
<h4>
    Don''t Reuse Everything
</h4>
<p>
    Reuse makes code and design cheap to use but expensive to build. It requires experience and thoughtful consideration to
    create an implementation or design that''s abstract enough for others to re-use, but concrete enough to be truly useful.
    Reusable code must also be maintained. Many organizations have difficulty assigning responsibility for maintaining
    reusable code if they don''t have a group dedicated to reuse.
</p>
<p>
    It''s usually not a good idea to create code or designs for reuse unless you know it''s going to be reused. It''s better
    to refactor software to be more reusable after it''s discovered that they can be reused. One rule of thumb is to write
    for reuse only when you know you''ll use it at least 3 times. Otherwise the cost of building and maintaining that part
    of the software will not be recovered by reduced overhead in other areas of development.

            <MainDescription><![CDATA[<h3>
    <a id="DeveloperTestingPitfalls" name="DeveloperTestingPitfalls"></a>Pitfalls Getting Started with Developer Testing
</h3>
<p>
    Many developers who begin trying to do a substantially more thorough job of testing give up the effort shortly
    thereafter. They find that it does not seem to be yielding value. Further, some developers who begin well with
    developer testing find that they''ve created an unmaintainable test suite that is eventually abandoned.
</p>
<h4>
    Establish expectations
</h4>
<p>
    Those who find developer testing rewarding do it. Those who view it as a chore find ways to avoid it. This is simply in
    the nature of most developers in most industries, and treating it as a shameful lack of discipline hasn''t historically
    been successful. Therefore, as a developer you should expect testing to be rewarding and do what it takes to make it
    rewarding.
</p>
<p>
    Ideal developer testing follows a very tight edit-test loop. You make a small change to the product, such as adding a
    new method to a class, then you immediately rerun your tests. If any test breaks, you know exactly what code is the
    cause. This easy, steady pace of development is the greatest reward of developer testing. A long debugging session
    should be exceptional.
</p>
<p>
    Because it''s not unusual for a change made in one class to break something in another, you should expect to rerun not
    just the changed class''s tests, but many tests. Ideally, you rerun the complete test suite for your component many
    times per hour. Every time you make a significant change, you rerun the suite, watch the results, and either proceed to
    the next change or fix the last change. Expect to spend some effort making that rapid feedback possible.
</p>
<h4>
    Automate your tests
</h4>
<p>
    Running tests often is not practical if tests are manual. For some components, automated tests are easy. An example
    would be an in-memory database. It communicates to its clients through an API and has no other interface to the outside
    world. Tests for it would look something like this:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
/* Check that elements can be added at most once. */
// Setup
Database db = new Database();
db.add("key1", "value1");
// Test
boolean result = db.add("key1", "another value");
expect(result == false);
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
    The tests are different from ordinary client code in only one way: instead of believing the results of API calls, they
    check. If the API makes client code easy to write, it makes test code easy to write. If the test code is <i>not</i>
    easy to write, you''ve received an early warning that the API could be improved. Test-first design is thus consistent
    with the iterative processes'' focus on addressing important risks early.
</p>
<p>
    The more tightly connected the component is to the outside world, however, the harder it will be to test. There are two
    common cases: graphical user interfaces and back-end components.
</p>
<h5>
    Graphical user interfaces
</h5>
<p>
    Suppose the database in the example above receives its data via a callback from a user-interface object. The callback
    is invoked when the user fills in some text fields and pushes a button. Testing this by manually filling in the fields
    and pushing the button isn''t something you want to do many times an hour. You must arrange a way to deliver the input
    under programmatic control, typically by "pushing" the button in code.
</p>
<p>
    Pushing the button causes some code in the component to be executed. Most likely, that code changes the state of some
    user-interface objects. So you must also arrange a way to query those objects programmatically.
</p>
<h5>
    Back-end components
</h5>
<p>
    Suppose the component under test doesn''t implement a database. Instead, it''s a wrapper around a real, on-disk database.
    Testing against that real database might be difficult. It might be hard to install and configure. Licenses for it might
    be expensive. The database might slow down the tests enough that you''re not inclined to run them often. In such cases,
    it''s worthwhile to "stub out" the database with a simpler component that does just enough to support the tests.
</p>
<p>
    Stubs are also useful when a component that your component talks to isn''t ready yet. You don''t want your testing to
    wait on someone else''s code.
</p>
<h4>
    Don''t write your own tools
</h4>
<p>
    Developer testing seems pretty straightforward. You set up some objects, make a call through an API, check the result,
    and announce a test failure if the results aren''t as expected. It''s also convenient to have some way to group tests so
    that they can be run individually or as complete suites. Tools that support those requirements are called <i>test
    frameworks</i>.
</p>
<p>
    Developer testing <b>is</b> straightforward, and the requirements for test frameworks are not complicated. If, however,
    you yield to the temptation of writing your own test framework, you''ll spend much more time tinkering with the
    framework than you probably expect. There are many test frameworks available, both commercial and open source, and
    there''s no reason not to use one of those.
</p>
<h4>
    Do create support code
</h4>
<p>
    Test code tends to be repetitive. It''s common to see sequences of code like this:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
// null name not allowed
retval = o.createName(""); 
expect(retval == null);
// leading spaces not allowed
retval = o.createName(" l"); 
expect(retval == null);
// trailing spaces not allowed
retval = o.createName("name "); 
expect(retval == null);
// first character may not be numeric
retval = o.createName("5allpha"); 
expect(retval == null);
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
    This code is created by copying one check, pasting it, then editing it to make another check.
</p>
<p>
    The danger here is twofold. If the interface changes, much editing will have to be done. (In more complicated cases, a
    simple global replacement won''t suffice.) Also, if the code is at all complicated, the intent of the test can be lost
    amid all the text.
</p>
<p>
    When you find yourself repeating yourself, seriously consider factoring out the repetition into support code. Even
    though the code above is a simple example, it''s more readable and maintainable if written like this:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
void expectNameRejected(MyClass o, String s) {
    Object retval = o.createName(s);
    expect(retval == null);
}
...
// null name not allowed
expectNameRejected(o, ""); 
// leading spaces not allowed.
expectNameRejected(o, " l"); 
// trailing spaces not allowed.
expectNameRejected(o, "name "); 
// first character may not be numeric.
expectNameRejected(o, "5alpha"); 
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
    Developers writing tests often err on the side of too much copying-and-pasting. If you suspect yourself of that
    tendency, it''s useful to consciously err in the other direction. Resolve that you will strip your code of all duplicate
    text.
</p>
<h4>
    Write the tests first
</h4>
<p>
    Writing the tests after the code is a chore. The urge is to rush through it, to finish up and move on. Writing tests
    before the code makes testing part of a positive feedback loop. As you implement more code, you see more tests passing
    until finally all the tests pass and you''re done. People who write tests first seem to be more successful, and it takes
    no more time. For more on putting tests first, see <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../../openup/guidances/guidelines/test_first_design_21C77ADF.html" guid="_0Y6kUMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">Guideline: Test-first Design</a>.
</p>
<h4>
    Keep the tests understandable
</h4>
<p>
    You should expect that you, or someone else, will have to modify the tests later. A typical situation is that a later
    iteration calls for a change to the component''s behavior. As a simple example, suppose the component once declared a
    square root method like this:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        <font size="+0">double sqrt(double x);</font>
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
    In that version, a negative argument caused <font size="+0">sqrt</font> to return NaN ("not a number" from the IEEE
    754-1985 <i>Standard for Binary Floating-Point Arithmetic</i>). In the new iteration, the square root method will
    accept negative numbers and return a complex result:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        <font size="+0">Complex sqrt(double x);</font>
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
    Old tests for <font size="+0">sqrt</font> will have to change. That means understanding what they do, and updating them
    so that they work with the new <font size="+0">sqrt</font>. When updating tests, you must take care not to destroy
    their bug-finding power. One way that sometimes happens is this:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
void testSQRT () {
    //  Update these tests for Complex 
    // when I have time -- bem
    /*
double result = sqrt(0.0);
...
    */
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
    Other ways are more subtle: the tests are changed so that they actually run, but they no longer test what they were
    originally intended to test. The end result, over many iterations, can be a test suite that is too weak to catch many
    bugs. This is sometimes called "test suite decay". A decayed suite will be abandoned, because it''s not worth the
    upkeep.
</p>
<p>
    Test suite decay is less likely in the direct tests for <font size="+0">sqrt</font> than in indirect tests. There will
    be code that calls <font size="+0">sqrt</font>. That code will have tests. When <font size="+0">sqrt</font> changes,
    some of those tests will fail. The person who changes <font size="+0">sqrt</font> will probably have to change those
    tests. Because he''s less familiar with them, and because their relationship to the change is less clear, he''s more
    likely to weaken them in the process of making them pass.
</p>
<p>
    When you''re creating support code for tests (as urged above), be careful: the support code should clarify, not obscure,
    the purpose of the tests that use it. A common complaint about object-oriented programs is that there''s no one place
    where anything''s done. If you look at any one method, all you discover is that it forwards its work somewhere else.
    Such a structure has advantages, but it makes it harder for new people to understand the code. Unless they make an
    effort, their changes are likely to be incorrect or to make the code even more complicated and fragile. The same is
    true of test code, except that later maintainers are even less likely to take due care. You must head off the problem
    by writing understandable tests.
</p>
<h4>
    Match the test structure to the product structure
</h4>
<p>
    Suppose someone has inherited your component. They need to change a part of it. They may want to examine the old tests
    to help them in their new design. They want to update the old tests before writing the code (test-first design).
</p>
<p>
    All those good intentions will go by the wayside if they can''t find the appropriate tests. What they''ll do is make the
    change, see what tests fail, then fix those. That will contribute to test suite decay.
</p>
<p>
    For that reason, it''s important that the test suite be well structured, and that the location of tests be predictable
    from the structure of the product. Most usually, developers arrange tests in a parallel hierarchy, with one test class
    per product class. So if someone is changing a class named <font size="+0">Log</font>, they know the test class is
    <font size="+0">TestLog</font>, and they know where the source file can be found.
</p>
<h4>
    Let tests violate encapsulation
</h4>
<p>
    You might limit your tests to interacting with your component exactly as client code does, through the same interface
    that client code uses. However, this has disadvantages. Suppose you''re testing a simple class that maintains a doubly
    linked list:
</p>
<p>
    In particular, you''re testing the <font size="+0">DoublyLinkedList.insertBefore(Object existing, Object
    newObject)</font> method. In one of your tests, you want to insert an element in the middle of the list, then check if
    it''s been inserted successfully. The test uses the list above to create this updated list:
</p>
<p>
    It checks the list correctness like this:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
// the list is now one longer. 
expect(list.size()==3);
// the new element is in the correct position
expect(list.get(1)==m);
// check that other elements are still there.
expect(list.get(0)==a);
expect(list.get(2)==z);
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
    That seems sufficient, but it''s not. Suppose the list implementation is incorrect and backward pointers are not set
    correctly. That is, suppose the updated list actually looks like this:
</p>
<p>
    If <font size="+0">DoublyLinkedList.get(int index)</font> traverses the list from the beginning to the end (likely),
    the test would miss this failure. If the class provides <font size="+0">elementBefore</font> and <font     size="+0">elementAfter</font> methods, checking for such failures is straightforward:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
// Check that links were all updated
expect(list.elementAfter(a)==m);
expect(list.elementAfter(m)==z);
expect(list.elementBefore(z)==m); //this will fail
expect(list.elementBefore(m)==a);
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
    But what if it doesn''t provide those methods? You could devise more elaborate sequences of method calls that will fail
    if the suspected defect is present. For example, this would work:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
// Check whether back-link from Z is correct.
list.insertBefore(z, x);
// If it was incorrectly not updated, X will have 
// been inserted just after A.
expect(list.get(1)==m); 
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
    But such a test is more work to create and is likely to be significantly harder to maintain. (Unless you write good
    comments, it will not be at all clear why the test is doing what it''s doing.) There are two solutions:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Add the <font size="+0">elementBefore</font> and <font size="+0">elementAfter</font> methods to the public
        interface. But that effectively exposes the implementation to everyone and makes future change more difficult.
    </li>
    <li>
        Let the tests "look under the hood" and check pointers directly.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    The latter is usually the best solution, even for a simple class like <font size="+0">DoublyLinkedList</font> and
    especially for the more complex classes that occur in your products.
</p>
<p>
    Typically, tests are put in the same package as the class they test. They are given protected or friend access.
</p>
<h3>
    <a id="TestDesignMistakes" name="TestDesignMistakes"></a>Characteristic Test Design Mistakes
</h3>
<p>
    Each test exercises a component and checks for correct results. The design of the test-the inputs it uses and how it
    checks for correctness-can be good at revealing defects, or it can inadvertently hide them. Here are some
    characteristic test design mistakes.
</p>
<h4>
    Failure to specify expected results in advance
</h4>
<p>
    Suppose you''re testing a component that converts XML into HTML. A temptation is to take some sample XML, run it through
    the conversion, then look at the results in a browser. If the screen looks right, you "bless" the HTML by saving it as
    the official expected results. Thereafter, a test compares the actual output of the conversion to the expected results.
</p>
<p>
    This is a dangerous practice. Even sophisticated computer users are used to believing what the computer does. You are
    likely to overlook mistakes in the screen appearance. (Not to mention that browsers are quite tolerant of misformatted
    HTML.) By making that incorrect HTML the official expected results, you make sure that the test can never find the
    problem.
</p>
<p>
    It''s less dangerous to doubly-check by looking directly at the HTML, but it''s still dangerous. Because the output is
    complicated, it will be easy to overlook errors. You''ll find more defects if you write the expected output by hand
    first.
</p>
<h4>
    Failure to check the background
</h4>
<p>
    Tests usually check that what should have been changed has been, but their creators often forget to check that what
    should have been left alone has been left alone. For example, suppose a program is supposed to change the first 100
    records in a file. It''s a good idea to check that the 101<sup>st</sup> hasn''t been changed.
</p>
<p>
    In theory, you would check that nothing in the "background"-the entire file system, all of memory, everything reachable
    through the network-has been left alone. In practice, you have to choose carefully what you can afford to check. But
    it''s important to make that choice.
</p>
<h4>
    Failure to check persistence
</h4>
<p>
    Just because the component tells you a change has been made, that doesn''t mean it has actually been committed to the
    database. You need to check the database via another route.
</p>
<h4>
    Failure to add variety
</h4>
<p>
    A test might be designed to check the effect of three fields in a database record, but many other fields need to be
    filled in to execute the test. Testers will often use the same values over and over again for these "irrelevant"
    fields. For example, they''ll always use the name of their lover in a text field, or 999 in a numeric field.
</p>
<p>
    The problem is that sometimes what shouldn''t matter actually does. Every so often, there''s a bug that depends on some
    obscure combination of unlikely inputs. If you always use the same inputs, you stand no chance of finding such bugs. If
    you persistently vary inputs, you might. Quite often, it costs almost nothing to use a number different than 999 or to
    use someone else''s name. When varying the values used in tests costs almost nothing and it has some potential benefit,
    then vary. (Note: It''s unwise to use names of old lovers instead of your current one if your current lover works with
    you.)
</p>
<p>
    Here''s another benefit. One plausible fault is for the program to use field <i>X</i> when it should have used field
    <i>Y</i>. If both fields contain "Dawn", the fault can''t be detected.
</p>
<h4>
    Failure to use realistic data
</h4>
<p>
    It''s common to use made-up data in tests. That data is often unrealistically simple. For example, customer names might
    be "Mickey", "Snoopy", and "Donald". Because that data is different from what real users enter - for example, it''s
    characteristically shorter - it can miss defects real customers will see. For example, these one-word names wouldn''t
    detect that the code doesn''t handle names with spaces.
</p>
<p>
    It''s prudent to make a slight extra effort to use realistic data.
</p>
<h4>
    Failure to notice that the code does nothing at all
</h4>
<p>
    Suppose you initialize a database record to zero, run a calculation that should result in zero being stored in the
    record, then check that the record is zero. What has your test demonstrated? The calculation might not have taken place
    at all. Nothing might have been stored, and the test couldn''t tell.
</p>
<p>
    That example sounds unlikely. But this same mistake can crop up in subtler ways. For example, you might write a test
    for a complicated installer program. The test is intended to check that all temporary files are removed after a
    successful installation. But, because of all the installer options, in that test, one particular temporary file wasn''t
    created. Sure enough, that''s the one the program forgot to remove.
</p>
<h4>
    Failure to notice that the code does the wrong thing
</h4>
<p>
    Sometimes a program does the right thing for the wrong reasons. As a trivial example, consider this code:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
if (a &lt; b &amp;&amp; c) 
    return 2 * x;
else
    return x * x;
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
    The logical expression is wrong, and you''ve written a test that causes it to evaluate incorrectly and take the wrong
    branch. Unfortunately, purely by coincidence, the variable X has the value 2 in that test. So the result of the wrong
    branch is accidentally correct - the same as the result the right branch would have given.
</p>
<p>
    For each expected result, you should ask if there''s a plausible way in which that result could be&nbsp;achieved for the
    wrong reason. While it''s often impossible to know, sometimes it''s not.

            <MainDescription><![CDATA[<p>
    Designing a system is about creating the internal structure and behavior of a system that''s robust, extensible, and
    high-quality. Good design improves quality and makes a system easier to maintain and extend, while a poor design can
    significantly raise the cost of producing and maintaining the software.
</p>
<p>
    Design is an abstraction of the code that presents the system from a perspective that makes it easier to address the
    structure and behavior of the software. This can be done through viewing the code, but it''s more difficult and less
    effective to address structural and behavioral issues this way. Design can be visual models, simple sketches, text
    descriptions, etc. The critical element of design is that it describes how different elements of the system interact to
    fulfill the requirements.
</p>
<p>
    The amount of design that''s formally documented and maintained will vary depending on the criticality of the design and
    how much of the design needs to be communicated to future team members. At a minimum, all architecturally significant
    design elements should be documented and kept up-to-date with the implementation. These are critical aspects of the
    system that are necessary for the understanding and maintenance of the software. Other important or complex structure
    and behavior may be maintained as well. And some contracts may require that the entire design is throughly documented.
</p>
<p>
    On many projects there will probably be aspects of the design that are only documented for the purpose of creating a
    solution or walking through how certain behavior will be realized. It may not be worth the overhead of maintaining this
    information as the design is transformed through refactoring and other influences. However, it may be useful to archive
    the initial decisions, whiteboard images, or files so they can be referenced in the future if necessary. These can be
    viewed as "old meeting minutes" that are stored for potential future reference. They may not reflect the current
    design, but they may still provide useful insight.
</p>
<h3>
    Multiple Passes
</h3>
<p>
    The design will be revisited many times throughout an iterative lifecycle and even within an iteration. Each time some
    design activity is being performed, it will be performed in the context of a specific goal. The goal might be to
    identify a notional set of participants in a collaboration that can be exercised to realize the behavior required (an
    analysis pass). The goal might be in the identification of some coarse-grained elements that are required to act out
    some scenario (an architectural pass). Then a pass might be done within one of those components to identify the
    elements within that will collaborate together to perform the behavior required (a more detailed design pass).<br />
    <br />
     Design might be performed in a particular context such as database context, user-interface context, or perhaps the
    context of how some existing library will be applied. In these cases the design steps will be performed just to make
    and communicate decisions regarding that context
</p>
<p>
    Avoid analysis paralysis. Avoid refining, extending, and improving the design beyond a minimal version that suffices to
    cover the needs of the requirements within the architecture. Design should be done in small chunks, proven via
    implementation, improved via refactoring, and integrated into the baseline to provide value to the stakeholders.
</p>
<h3>
    Design versus Architecture
</h3>
<p>
    Design is a real thing, the construction of the system’s structure and behavior. Architecture [link to concept on
    Software Architecture] defines principles, contexts, and constraints on the system’s construction. Architecture is
    described in architecture artifacts, but it’s realized as design (visual or otherwise) and implementation.<br />
    <br />
     One way to look at architecture is that it helps to make the entire design more cohesive with itself by balancing the
    needs of the entire system. Design tends to focus on one area at a time. Architecture helps assure the design is
    consistent and appropriate to the goals of the system. For instance, there may be constraints placed on most of the
    design to support the performance of one part of the system, such as improving access to a legacy system. Failure to
    conform to those constraints in the design may cause the system to fail to meet the performance requirements of the
    legacy system access. Conforming to the architecture assures that all the goals of the system are met by balancing
    competing technical issues.
</p>
<h3>
    Quality of Design
</h3>
<h4>
    You Arn''t Going to Need It
</h4>
<p>
    The YAGNI principle is a good general approach to design. While designs should be robust enough to modify, re-use, and
    maintain, it should also be as simple as possible. One of the ways to keep it simple is to make few assumptions about
    what the design''s going to need in the future. Don''t assume you''ll need something until you know you need it, then do a
    good job of adding it. Add what''s needed for the current requirement or iteration. Refactor the design as necessary
    when more functionality needs to be added or the design must be made more complex to deal with new circumstances.
</p>
<h4>
    Coupling and Cohesion
</h4>
<p>
    Two of the most fundamental principles of design are coupling and cohesion. A good design contains elements that have
    high cohesion and low coupling. High cohesion means that a single element, such as a class or subsystem, is composed of
    parts that are closely related or work closely together to fulfill some purpose. Low coupling means that the elements
    of a system have a minimum of dependencies on each other. A single element such as a subsystem should be easily
    replaceable by another subsystem that provides similar behavior.<br />
    <br />
     For example, in a payroll system an Employee class would have high cohesion if it contained elements and functions
    such as Name, Tax ID Number, and Monthly Salary. At first, it may seem as if the Calculate Paycheck functional would
    also be cohesive. But when you consider that hourly employees must be paid overtime, sales people must have commission
    calculated for them, etc, the function is less related to Employee and should probably be its own class or
    subsystem.<br />
    <br />
     An example of low coupling would be if the Calculate Paycheck subsystem can be easily replaced by third party that may
    be more robust and offer more features.<br />
    <br />
     Coupling and cohesion are so important to be aware of because they arise in so many design principles and design
    strategies such as patterns.
</p>
<h4>
    Open-Closed Principle
</h4>
<p>
    Elements in the design should be “open” for extension but “closed” for modification. The goal of this principle is to
    create software than can be extended without changing code <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../openup/guidances/supportingmaterials/references_6CCF393.html#MEY97" guid="_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg">[MEY97]</a>. This is because every change to software runs the risk of introducing bugs
    into code that’s already correct. It also allows functionality to be re-used without having to know the details of the
    implementation, reducing the time it takes to create something new. Keeping this principle in mind helps make a design
    more maintainable.<br />

            <MainDescription><![CDATA[<h1>
    Identification of elements
</h1>
<p>
    Identify the elements, based on the needs of the requirements. The identification of elements can stem from a static
    perspective of walking through the requirements and identifying elements clearly called out, which is a form of domain
    modeling. This can pull in other elements identified as being in the application domain or deemed necessary from
    examining the requirements for the portion of the system being designed. This identification can also pull from key
    abstractions identified while defining the architecture.
</p>
<p>
    The identification of elements should also apply a dynamic perspective by walking through scenarios of use of the
    system (or subsystem) and identifying elements needed to support the behavior. That behavior might be a scenario of use
    from an external user perspective or, while designing a subsystem, a responsibility assigned to the subsystem that has
    complex algorithmic behavior. Consider applying the <a class="elementLink"
    href="./../../../openup/guidances/guidelines/entity_control_boundary_pattern.html"
    guid="_uF-QYEAhEdq_UJTvM1DM2Q">Entity-Control-Boundary Pattern</a> to identify the elements necessary to support the
    scenario, or apply other patterns identified in the architecture that specify the elements that will be used to support
    specific aspects of the scenario.
</p>
<p>
    If you are designing a real-time system, include elements to represent events and signals that allow you to describe
    the asynchronous triggers of behavior to which the system must respond. <b>Events</b> are specifications of interesting
    occurrences in time and space that usually (if they are noteworthy) require some response from the system.
    <b>Signals</b> represent asynchronous mechanisms used to communicate certain types of events within the system.
</p>
<p>
    If there are existing elements from previous passes over the design or from selected frameworks or other reusable
    elements, reuse them whenever possible. See <a class="elementLinkWithType"
    href="./../../../openup/guidances/guidelines/software_reuse.html" guid="_vO2uoO0OEduUpsu85bVhiQ">Guideline: Software
    Reuse</a>.
</p>
<p>
    After identifying the elements, give each one meaningful name. Each element should also have a description, so that the
    team members who work together to refine the design and implement from the design will understand the role that each
    element plays.
</p>
<p>
    Based on this information, the identification of elements could be applied several times in designing just one part of
    the system. Although there is no one correct strategy for multiple passes, they could be done at a coarse-grained level
    and then a fine-grained level, or at an analysis (abstract) level and then a design level.
</p>
<h1>
    Behavior of elements
</h1>
<p>
    To identify the behavior of the elements, go through scenarios and assign behavior to the appropriate collaborating
    participants. If a particular use of the system or subsystem can have multiple possible outcomes or variant sequences,
    cover enough scenarios to ensure that the design is robust enough to support the possibilities.
</p>
<p>
    When assigning behavior to elements, consider applying the <a class="elementLink"
    href="./../../../openup/guidances/guidelines/entity_control_boundary_pattern.html"
    guid="_uF-QYEAhEdq_UJTvM1DM2Q">Entity-Control-Boundary Pattern</a>&nbsp;or other patterns identified in the
    architecture.
</p>
<p>
    Behavior can be represented as a simple statement of responsibility, or it can be a detailed operation specification.
    Use the appropriate level of detail to communicate important design decisions while giving the freedom to make
    appropriate implementation decisions as those tasks ensue.
</p>
<p>
    Avoid too much identification of behavior solely from the perspective of domain modeling. Include only behavior that is
    really needed -- behavior identified by going through required scenarios of system use.
</p>
<p>
    Behavior must be understood as a responsibility of an element, as well as an interaction between two elements in the
    context of some broader behavior of the system or subsystem. The latter part of this will lead the developer to
    identify relationships that are necessary between the elements.
</p>
<h1>
    Design element relationships
</h1>
<p>
    The relationships between the elements necessary for the behavior must be designed. This can simply be the
    identification of the ability to traverse from one element to another or else a need to manage an association between
    the elements. Relationships can be designed in more detail, as appropriate. This can include: optionality,
    multiplicity, whether the relationship is a simple dependency or managed association, and so on. These decisions that
    drive implementation details are best made at the design level, where it is easier to see how all of the pieces fit
    together.
</p>
<p>
    Avoid defining too many relationships based on relationships in the application domain. Include only relationships that
    are needed based on the requirements. On the other hand, a combination of requirements knowledge and domain knowledge
    can lead to some detailed decisions on the relationships, such as optionality and multiplicity.
</p>
<h1>
    Analysis classes and YAGNI
</h1>
<p>
    Analysis classes are used to identify initial buckets where system functionality should go. They''re the first pass at
    understanding where system behavior will be realized in the design and implementation. For example, an entity class
    might initially represent all of the behavior for an employee, such as storing personal information and calculating the
    value of a paycheck. Few assumptions are made about how the final design will look at this point. Analysis classes are
    about making sure required behavior is represented somewhere in the system, rather than about creating a perfect
    design.
</p>
<p>
    Analysis classes allow you to begin designing from abstractions, so that the details of the system depend on those
    abstractions and not the other way around. In the Employee class, the notion of an employee should start with the idea
    of someone who works for the company, who has responsibilities and receives benefits. It’s easier to create a design
    from this simple idea. The complexity of the design should emerge from the abstract ideas of what the design needs to
    do. This will also help keep coupling low and cohesion high.
</p>
<p>
    YAGNI (You Aren''t Going to Need It) is an approach to design where the developer creates only enough implementation and
    design to address the required functionality. No assumptions are made about re-use or possible future uses of the
    software. Software is improved when the system requirements demand more functionality or robustness.
</p>
<p>
    The first classes created from a YAGNI perspective are much like analysis classes. You don''t know how complex it may be
    to calculate a paycheck for your employee, so you assume that functionality is highly cohesive with the rest of what
    the Employee class must do. As you understanding of the requirement develops, the analysis class evolves into a set of
    collaborating classes and patterns that better support the behavior of the system. For example, payroll calculations
    could be moved into a pattern that handles all of the different types of paycheck calculations (overtime, commissions,
    and so forth), thereby increasing the internal cohesion of the class.
</p>
<p>
    Use analysis classes to define an initial place to put system behavior, and add only enough behavior to satisfy the
    YAGNI perspective. Analysis classes will evolve into concrete design classes as more behavior is added and as the
    design is refactored. See <a class="elementLinkWithType"

            <MainDescription><![CDATA[<h1> Review the design </h1>
<p> Design is best accomplished collaboratively, because it is a problem-solving 
  activity with a range of&nbsp;parts and perspectives. There should be a constant 
  level of review to ensure that the decisions make sense within the area being 
  designed and in the design of the system overall. There also might be occasions 
  where some area of design is reviewed by a set of interested or knowledgeable 
  parties, such as the architect who will verify that the design conforms to an 
  architectural decision or a developer who will be expected to implement the 
  design. </p>
<p> The design should be examined to ensure that it follows heuristics of quality 
  design, such as loose coupling and high cohesion. Responsibilities should be 
  appropriately distributed to elements in ways that there are no elements with 
  too much responsibility and no elements that are left without any responsibilities. 
  The design should be able to clearly communicate the design decisions, yet not 
  delve into concerns best dealt with during implementation of code.</p>
<p> Ensure that the design follows any project-specific guidelines and conforms 
  to the architecture. Modifications to the design to improve it (based on issues 
  identified in reviewing it) should apply <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../openup/guidances/guidelines/refactoring_33F165CA.html" guid="_OlyWoOX7Edu8VZPtlaU33g">Refactoring</a>&nbsp;to 
  ensure that the design and any existing implementation of the design continues 
  to fulfill its responsibilities. </p>
Revisit the relationships between elements to improve the coupling in the design. 
Remove redundant relationships, try to make relationships unidirectional, and 
so forth. See <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../../openup/guidances/guidelines/analyze_the_design_4C4750C0.html" guid="__MnggPTdEduDKIuqTXQ8SA">Guideline: 
Analyze the Design</a> for more information. 
<h1> Refine the design </h1>
<p> After creating an implementation that includes a set of collaborating elements, 
  with the behavior and relationships robust enough to pass developer tests, the 
  design can be improved and transformed into a more robust and maintainable system. 
</p>
<p> The visibility of each operation should be selected to be as restrictive as 
  possible. Based on walking through the scenario, it should be clear which operations 
  must be available to other elements in the design and which can be considered 
  behavior inside of the element that has the operation. Minimizing the number 
  of public operations creates a more maintainable and understandable design. 
</p>
<p> With respect to parameters, the return value, and a description of how it 
  perform the behavior, operations can be detailed at a lower level that drives 
  the actual implementation, or that detail might be left to be handled when writing 
  the code. </p>
<p> Data attributes can be identified based on information needed to support behavior 
  or based on additional requirements, such as information to be presented to 
  the user or transmitted to another system. Avoid indiscriminate domain analysis, 
  because there might be a great deal of data in the domain that is not needed 
  to support the requirements. Data attributes can simply be identified or they 
  can be designed in detail, with attribute types, initial values, and constraints. 
  Decide on the visibility of the data attribute; operations to access and update 
  the data can be added or deferred until implementation. </p>
<p> Generalization and interfaces can be applied to simplify or otherwise improve 
  the design. Ensure that the use of these techniques actually improves the design, 
  rather than bogging it down with complexity. For example, common behavior can 
  be factored into a parent class through generalization or out to a helper class 
  through delegation. The latter solution can be more understandable and maintainable, 
  because generalization is an inflexible relationship (see the section that follows 
  on inheritance). </p>
<p> The refinement of any portion of the design could include another pass through 
  the design process. You might find that what was initially identified as a single 
  behavior of an element warrants a detailed walkthrough of the collaborating 
  elements to realize that behavior. </p>
<p> When updating an existing design -- especially one that has had portions already 
  implemented -- apply <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../openup/guidances/guidelines/refactoring_33F165CA.html" guid="_OlyWoOX7Edu8VZPtlaU33g">Refactoring</a> 
  to ensure that the improved design continues to perform as expected. </p>
<h2> Organize elements </h2>
<p> In a design of any notable size, the elements must be organized into packages. 
  Assign the elements to existing or new packages, and ensure that the visibility 
  relationships between the packages support the navigation required between the 
  elements. Decide whether each element should be visible to elements outside 
  of the package. </p>
<p> When structuring the design into packages, consider <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../openup/guidances/guidelines/layering_F169CF07.html" guid="_0gpkAMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">Layering</a> 
  and other patterns. Although all design work must conform to existing architectural 
  decisions, the allocation of elements to packages and possible updates to package 
  visibility are of significant architectural concern. The developer should collaborate 
  with the architect to ensure that package-level decisions are in accordance 
  with the rest of the architecture. </p>
<p> This guideline first talks about the identification and design of the elements 
  and then about organizing the elements into packages. However, this is not a 
  strict order of events. There is nothing wrong with identifying a package structure 
  for the system and then populating that structure with identified elements, 
  as long as the actual elements identified are allowed to influence the resulting 
  package structure. See the sections on identification and behavior of elements 
  in <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../../openup/guidances/guidelines/analyze_the_design_4C4750C0.html" guid="__MnggPTdEduDKIuqTXQ8SA">Guideline: 
  Analyze the Design</a>. </p>
<h2> Identify patterns </h2>
<p> Identifying <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../openup/guidances/concepts/pattern_10BE6D96.html" guid="_0YJvUMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">Pattern</a>s 
  and seeking opportunities to leverage patterns are useful techniques. The value 
  of patterns here is that they provide a shortcut to a robust design. For instance, 
  when there''s an interface realized by multiple classes, it’s possible that an 
  Abstract Factory pattern will be useful, because the pattern encapsulates the 
  logic of what class should be instantiated. The more experienced a developer 
  is, the better the developer is at identifying opportunities to take advantage 
  of, or leverage, patterns. </p>
<p> The longer you use patterns, the easier it will be to identify opportunities 
  to leverage them. At first, look for places where you can clearly specify the 
  need for some behavior. Perhaps there''s a place where some function or algorithm 
  must be shared between many different classes. How can this behavior be shared 
  over and over among heterogeneous classes? Or perhaps a third-party library 
  is replacing a block of custom code. Is there a way to make this transition 
  easier by creating an interface that can use either implementation? These are 
  opportunities for finding or possibly creating a pattern. </p>

<h1> Inheriting behavior versus inheriting interfaces </h1>
<p> Inheritance (or generalization) is often used as a shortcut during implementation 
  to quickly re-use behavior (code).</p>
<p><b>Caution: </b><br />
  Work hard to remove behavior inheritance in design. It will almost always cost 
  more effort than it saves. </p>
<p> Inheritance is a very rigid structure with strict rules. A class that inherits 
  from another class is establishing an<b> is-a</b> relationship. The inheriting 
  class is a type of the parent class-- the child has the same relationships and 
  behaviors as the parent. In most hierarchies, it will be impossible to maintain 
  this type of relationship. Exceptions quickly creep in, and it’s common to find 
  child classes that remove or override behavior in the parent classes. This increases 
  maintenance costs and makes it difficult to understand what each class does. 
</p>
<p>
    It’s also too tempting to instantiate parent classes, which makes the parent class both abstract and concrete. If a
    class has children, it must be abstract enough to support the generalized behavior of the children. But if it’s
    instantiated, it must be concrete enough to provide specific behavior. It’s rarely possible to fulfill both of these
    competing imperatives at the same time, and the design suffers.
</p>
<p>
    Use association and aggregation relationships instead of inheriting behavior. Patterns are a good tool to leverage in
    breaking up inheritance hierarchies.
</p>
<p> Inheriting interfaces is safe, because only the description and not the implementation 
  of what needs to be done is reused. </p>
<p>
    Avoiding inheriting behavior is an application of the Open-Closed Principle. See <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../../openup/guidances/concepts/design_E36137FA.html" guid="_bFjlAPTYEduDKIuqTXQ8SA">Concept: Design</a> for

<h2> <strong>Consider the architecture</strong> </h2>
<p> The architecture must be considered in all design changes. The “best” design 
  for a particular part of the solution may not be appropriate because of architectural 
  constraints that must support the entire system. The architecture may also help 
  to make design decisions, because it can be part of the selection criteria between 
  two potential solutions. Developers should always be up-to-date with the architecture 
  and review it often, particularly in early iterations. </p>
<p> This guideline remarks on conforming to the architecture in various ways; 
  it is written as though it is about designing within a pre-existing architecture. 
  Although projects will often have pre-existing architectures available, a particular 
  architecture is the result of design activities. Therefore, in addition to discussing 
  conformance to some existing architecture, you must also consider the creation 
  of the architecture, as well as updates and improvements based on the work of 
  design. </p>

            <MainDescription><![CDATA[<p>
    Test-first design is the practice of writing&nbsp;developer tests and&nbsp;implementation code concurrently and at a
    very fine level of granularity.
</p>
<p>
    In test-first design, the developer first writes a small portion of a&nbsp;developer test, and then writes just
    enough&nbsp;implementation code to make that&nbsp;developer test compile and execute. Then they write a little bit more
    of the test and then add enough code to make that new bit compile and pass. This cycle can last somewhere between 30
    seconds and five minutes. Rarely does it grow to ten minutes. In each cycle, the tests come first. Once a unit test is
    done, the&nbsp;developer goes on to the next test until there are no more tests to be written for the implementation of
    the work item currently under development.
</p>
<p>
    The practice of test-first&nbsp;design changes how&nbsp;the developer&nbsp;thinks. Tests are not written as an
    afterthought. Instead, developer tests are written as part of the everyday, every minute way of building software.
</p>
<p>
    What are&nbsp;the advantages of test-first design?
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Assumptions in the design are analyzed before the implementation code is written. To write developer tests, an
        examination must be made of the behavior of each piece of code to be written, correct and incorrect behaviors must
        be defined. In&nbsp;a way, writing the tests before the code can be considered a version of detailed design.
    </li>
    <li>
        Code units designed&nbsp;for testability up front are cleaner and more loosely coupled.
    </li>
    <li>
        Errors&nbsp;are found earlier. Errors or gaps in the requirements and design are identified before coding begins
        when it could be more tempting to move ahead based on assumptions.
    </li>
    <li>
        A clearer&nbsp;collaboration strategy between the developer and others that might be responsible for the
        requirements, architecture, and design is put in place.&nbsp;During the creation of the tests, there must be a
        meeting of the minds as to what&nbsp;has been specified. After that, the implementation can carry on with
        confidence that there is a shared vision of what the code should do.
    </li>
    <li>
        There are unambiguous criteria for completion of the code. When the tests pass, the code is working as specified.
        Non-functional quality dimensions can be dealt with separately, but there is a clear moment when the code behaves
        correctly.
    </li>
    <li>
        The technique drives the developer to work in smaller increments with faster quality feedback. At any time the
        developer is just one test away from having error-free code.
    </li>
    <li>
        There is a separation of concerns and effort between getting code working and improving the quality of the code
        that already runs correctly. Separating out these two areas of concern provides focus and time management support
        to a developer who in one pass over the implementation makes it pass the tests as simply as possible and then in a
        subsequent pass, looks for areas to improve.
    </li>

            <MainDescription><![CDATA[<p>
    With collective code ownership, any member of the team can change any piece of code in the system at any time. There
    should not be a policy or norm that one person is responsible for one part of the code base so that others are not
    allowed to modify it.
</p>
<p>
    Fostering an environment where any developer might be expected to modify any piece of code to implement some
    functionality, fix a bug, or improve the solution leads to a more collaborative team experience. Developers will become
    familiar with more of the code and benefit from the experience of others. It drives a high-performance team and removes
    hurdles so that changes can be made by those who need them when they need them. No one person can become the gatekeeper
    or bottleneck for changes to some subsystem within the code base.
</p>
<p>
    Collective code ownership works best if there are coding standards in place so that there are not problems, where one
    developer''s style is significantly different than another''s (see <a class="elementLinkWithType"
    href="./../../../openup/guidances/concepts/coding_standard.html" guid="_0lnRMMqOEduwrYVlQ9zp3w">Concept: Coding
    Standard</a>). It is also critical that there are developer tests in place to ensure that work on a unit of code does
    not break it.

            <MainDescription><![CDATA[<p>
    Test suites help manage the complexity of the test implementation. Many system test efforts fail because testers get
    lost in the minutia of all of the detailed tests, and struggle to organize work and communicate results at an
    appropriate level of detail. Much like UML packages, test suites provide a hierarchy of encapsulating containers to
    help manage the test implementation. They collect tests together in related groups that can be planned, managed, and
    assessed in a meaningful way.
</p>
<p>
    This might be one or more automated regression test suites, but a test suite can also be a work plan for implementing a
    set of related manual test scripts. Test suites can be nested hierarchically, so one test suite can contain others.
</p>
<p>
    Consider creating test suites that arrange the available test scripts, in addition to other test suites, in many
    different combinations: the more variations you have, the more you''ll increase coverage and the potential for finding
    errors. Give thought to a variety of test suites that will cover the breadth and depth of the target test items.
    Remember that a single test script (or test suite) may appear in many different test suites, so your tools should
    prevent unnecessarily repeated runs of the same test.
</p>
<p>
    At a minimum, it''s a good practice to start by organizing suites along the lines of major functional areas in the
    application. However, test suites might also relate directly to a subsystem or other system design element, or to
    requirements such as quality dimensions,&nbsp;standards compliance, and other requirements&nbsp;concerns that cut
    across the internal system elements.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    Some test automation tools provide the ability to automatically generate or assemble test suites.

&lt;p>&#xD;
    For each failing test script, analyze the Test Log to identify the cause of the test failure. Begin with failing tests&#xD;
    that you expected to begin passing against this build, which may indicate newly delivered work items that do not meet&#xD;
    the conditions of satisfaction. Then review previously passing test scripts that are now failing, which may indicate&#xD;
    regressive issues in the build.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        If a test failed because the solution does not meet the conditions of satisfaction for the test case, log the issue&#xD;
        in the Work Items List. In the work item, clearly identify the observed behavior, the expected behavior, and steps&#xD;
        to repeat the issue. Note which failing test initially discovered the issue.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;

        If a test failed because of a change in the system (such as a user-interface change), but the implementation still&#xD;
        meets the conditions of satisfaction in the test case, update the test script to pass with the new implementation.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        If a test failed because the test script is incorrect (a false negative result) or passed when it was expected to&#xD;
        fail (a false positive result), update the test script to correctly implement the conditions of satisfaction in the&#xD;
        test case. If the test case for a requirement is invalid, perform the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot; href=&quot;./../../openup/tasks/request_change_A048C387.html&quot; guid=&quot;_0mwzEclgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw&quot;>Task: Request Change&lt;/a> to&#xD;

            <MainDescription><![CDATA[<h3>
    Introduction
</h3>
<p>
    During testing, you will encounter failures related to the execution of your tests in different forms, such as code
    defects, user errors, program malfunctions, and test scripting issues. This&nbsp;concept discusses some ways to conduct
    failure analysis and then to report your findings.
</p>
<h3>
    Failure Analysis
</h3>
<p>
    After you run the tests, its good practice to identify inputs for review of the results of the testing effort. Some
    likely sources are defects that occurred during the execution of test scripts, change request metrics, and&nbsp;<a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../../openup/workproducts/test_log_CBA2FDF4.html" guid="_0ZlSsMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">Artifact: Test Log</a> details.
</p>
<p>
    Running test scripts results in errors of different kinds such as uncovered defects, unexpected behavior, or general
    failure of the test script to run properly. When you run test scripts, one of the most important things to do is to
    distinguish between the causes and effects of failure. It is important to differentiate failures in the system under
    test&nbsp;from those related to the tests themselves.
</p>
<p>
    Change request metrics are useful in analyzing and correcting failures in the testing. Select metrics that will
    facilitate creation of incident reports from a collection of change requests.
</p>
<p>
    Change request metrics that you may find useful in your failure analysis include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        test coverage
    </li>
    <li>
        priority
    </li>
    <li>
        impact
    </li>
    <li>
        defect trends
    </li>
    <li>
        density
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Finally, one of the most critical sources of your failure analysis is the&nbsp;<a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../../openup/workproducts/test_log_CBA2FDF4.html" guid="_0ZlSsMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">Artifact: Test Log</a>.
    Relevant logs might come from many sources: they might be captured by the tools you use (both test execution and
    diagnostic tools), generated by automated tests or metrics tools, output from the target test items themselves, or
    recorded manually by the tester. Gather all of the available test log sources and examine their content. Check that all
    the scheduled testing executed to completion, and that all the needed tests&nbsp;have been scheduled.
</p>
<h3>
    Self-Documenting Tests
</h3>
<p>
    For automated tests, its important for the&nbsp;test itself to examine the results and clearly report itself as passing
    or failing. This provides the most efficient way to run a suite of tests without the need for human intervention. When
    authoring self-documenting tests, ensure that the reporting considers both passing and failing results.
</p>
<h3>
    Recording Your Findings
</h3>
<p>
    Once you have conducted your failure analysis, you might decide to formalize the results of this analysis by recording
    your findings in a report. There are several factors that go into deciding whether to record your failure analysis in a
    report. Some of the key factors include: level of testing formality, complexity of the testing effort, and the need to
    communicate the testing results to the entire development team. In less formal environments, it may be sufficient to
    record your failure analysis in&nbsp;a summary fashion.

            <MainDescription><![CDATA[<h3>
    Introduction
</h3>
<p>
    At some point in your test effort, you may find it necessary to manage your test effort by creating test suites for
    your test assets.&nbsp;Maintaining test suites can take many different forms. To facilitate your testing, you may want
    to introduce some&nbsp;level of&nbsp;automation of your test suites.&nbsp;The fact that you''ve automated your test
    suites does not necessarily make your testing easier however. It may actually increase the maintenance burden of your
    suites.
</p>
<p>
    This guideline introduces you to useful heuristics on how to facilitate the maintenance of your automated test suites.
</p>
<h4>
    Plan your test&nbsp;suites
</h4>
<p>
    Automating your testing without planning increases&nbsp;the chances that testing will be ineffective
    and&nbsp;inefficient.&nbsp;Some level of planning should take place whether implicit or explicit.&nbsp;An essential
    part of any test plan is the definition of a strategy for test automation.&nbsp;Use your plan to articulate to the
    development team how you plan to maintain your test assets.&nbsp;In many cases, this is never done.&nbsp;The rest of
    the development team may be unaware of how you intend to maintain your tests.&nbsp;It is also a good practice to get
    the rest of the development team to understand that this maintenance can be a substantial part of the overall
    development effort.&nbsp;Use your test tooling to capture this information and treat this plan just like you would
    treat any other test asset in your test repository.
</p>
<h4>
    Centrally locate your test assets
</h4>
<p>
    To facilitate the maintenance of your automated test suites, locate your test assets in a repository that can be
    accessed by the development team.&nbsp;Many test automation environments provide test management tools that make it
    easier to organize and access your test assets by maintaining the test assets (test cases, test scripts, and test
    suites) in a common repository.
</p>
<p>
    In addition, some form of access control is enforced by the automation test tool.&nbsp;This eases the maintenance
    burden by ensuring the integrity of your test suites.&nbsp;You may choose to grant stakeholders and managers read-only
    access, whereas developers and testers at the practitioner level may have read/write access.
</p>
<h4>
    Treat your test assets like any other software
</h4>
<p>
    Software must be maintained.&nbsp;This also applies to the software in your test suites.&nbsp;Test cases and their
    associated test scripts, whether recorded or programmed, should be maintained.&nbsp;And just as software has different
    kinds of maintenance (e.g., corrective, preventative, or adaptive) so too do the assets in your automated test suites.
    As you lifecycle your test suites, identify, if only informally,&nbsp;how&nbsp;you plan to disposition the test suite
    corrective maintenance (e.g., syntactical errors in your scripts),&nbsp;preventative maintenance (e.g., where possible
    to write generalized test scripts), and adaptive maintenance (e.g., how you&nbsp;can use your test tooling to re-assign
    test&nbsp;assets within one suite to&nbsp;another suite or suites).&nbsp;This can be captured, as described in the
    section <strong>Plan Your Test Suites</strong> above, in your test plan.
</p>
<h4>
    Improve the testability of your test suites through collaboration with developers
</h4>
<p>
    It''s one thing to say that your test suites will need to be maintained due to changes in the application, changes in
    the testing target, etc.&nbsp;It''s quite another thing to actually determine whether a test suite needs to be
    revamped&nbsp;and, if it does, what test assets within it need to be addressed.
</p>
<p>
    One way to facilitate this is to use test suites as a way to communicate test decision to the developers.&nbsp;One way
    to perform continuous perfective maintenance of test suites is to think of your test suites as assets that belong to
    the development team rather than just the testers.&nbsp; You can perform a kind of perfective maintenance on test in
    the following ways:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        use test suites to raise the level of abstraction
    </li>
    <li>
        use test suites to provide focus for the developer
    </li>
    <li>
        use test suites to articulate areas that the developers would like testers to focus on
    </li>
    <li>
        make the construction and maintenance&nbsp;of test suites more efficient&nbsp;by understanding what area(s)
        developers want to focus on
    </li>
    <li>
        use test suites to clarify test targets with developers
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    Don''t be afraid to clean up your suites
</h4>
<p>
    Your test assets will evolve just as the application under test will.&nbsp;As requirements to the system change, the
    application will change as well.&nbsp;To maintain your test suites, you should continually&nbsp;check whether test
    assets are valid.&nbsp;If possible, validity checks should be performed after each new release of the software,
    preferably more frequently.&nbsp;Keeping your test suites relevant is a full-time job.&nbsp;Assume that changes in the
    software will lead to some degree of invalid tests within your test suites.&nbsp;Once these test assets have been
    identified as invalid, get rid of them.&nbsp;This will make the maintenance burden much more tolerable.&nbsp;Some
    automated test tooling environments make this task easier by providing ways to package outdated or invalid
    tests.&nbsp;In some cases, you may not be absolutely sure whether you want to completely get rid of tests within your
    test suite or even of getting rid of test suites altogether.&nbsp; To alleviate this burden, you can create packages
    for obsolete tests or test suites and dispose of tests or test suites by putting them in packages labeled for this
    purpose.

    Introduction
</h3>
<p>
    Although the programming of automated tests should contribute to the overall test effort, it usually does not make up
    the entire test effort. In fact, test environments that are based on a complete automation approach end up spending
    more time on test automation than on testing. Before you begin developing automated test scripts, consider first
    whether it is more efficient to perform manual testing. Some aspects of an application are more efficiently tested
    manually (for example, GUI testing versus data-drive testing). If you decide to program automated test scripts, examine
    what aspects of your test scripting can be automated and begin designing your scripts.
</p>
<h3>
    Design your automated tests
</h3>
<p>
    Without some level of design of your automated tests, introducing automation into your testing effort can lead to more
    problems than it solves. You should consider developing your automated tests according to a lifecycle with automation
    test requirements, design, testing of the automation tests, and implementation of the automation tests. This approach
    can be informal or formal depending on your project needs. By designing the programming of your automated tests, you
    can avoid spending time programming the wrong tests, re-working programmed tests, deciphering different coding styles
    in the programming of the tests, etc.
</p>
<h3>
    Recorded versus programmed scripts
</h3>
<p>
    Although there are clear benefits to recorded scripts (for example, ease of creation or ability for novice testers to
    learn a scripting language), recorded scripts also present their own problems. The disadvantages of playback scripts
    are well known. They are deceptively easy to create but very difficult to update. Problems with script reliability,
    hard-coded data values, or changes to the application under test and the need to re-record are well-documented. On the
    other hand, programming scripts can present difficulties of their own: they are difficult for the novice tester to
    create, they can require substantial time and effort to develop, and they can be difficult to debug. Most test tooling
    makes these issues less problematic by providing the tester script support functions, such as ways to establish target
    of test lists, systematic ways to program verification point, point to datapools, build commands into the script (for
    example, sleeper commands), comment the script, and document the script. Another major advantage, which is often
    overlooked, of using testing tooling to mitigate these risks is the ability to add to an existing script in the form of
    making corrections to an existing script, testing new features of a test target or application under test, or resuming
    a recording after an interruption.
</p>
<h3>
    Functional and performance test scripts
</h3>
<p>
    When discussing automating test scripts, it is important to distinguish between functional and performance tests. Most
    discussions of programming automated test scripts focus on testing the functionality of an application. This is not
    inappropriate, since a lot of automated testing focuses on functional testing. Performance test scripting, however, has
    its unique characteristics. Performance test automation provides you with the ability to programmatically set workloads
    by adding user groups to test loads under group usage, setting think time behavior, running tests randomly or at set
    rates, or setting the duration of a run. Performance test automation also allows you to create and maintain schedules
    for your tests.
</p>
<h3>
    Testing test scripts
</h3>
<p>
    When testing your test scripts, keep in mind whether you are testing recorded or programmed test scripts. For recorded
    scripts, much of the debugging of the script consists of errors that are introduced due to changes in the test target
    or test environment. When you run a recorded test script, consider the test target of the script. Some test automation
    tools capture this information as a part of the test script. Debugging a recorded script consists largely of
    determining whether changes in the target have created error conditions in the script. In general, there are two main
    categories to examine here: changes in the UI and test session sensitive data (for example, date stamped data). In most
    cases, discrepancies between recording and playback cause errors in your recorded test scripts.
</p>
<p>
    Testing programmed test scripts involves many of the same debugging techniques you would apply to debugging an
    application. Consider both the flow control logic and the data aspects of your script. Automated testing tools provide
    you with test script debugging IDEs as well as datapool management features that facilitate this type of testing.
    During execution of test scripts, a test that uses a datapool can replace values in the programmed test with variable
    test data that is stored in the datapool.

    A change set is a logical grouping of related changes made to the implementation and supporting artifacts. Change sets
    are defined for a specific purpose and encompass all changes made to achieve that purpose.
</p>
<p>
    Change sets allow for multiple related changes to be referred to as single item, simplifying tracking of&nbsp;that

</p>
<p>
    The change set forms the basic unit of configuration control, accountability, and collaboration on the development

    correction of configuration inconsistencies. The relationship between items in a change set can be used to verify that

<p>
    Change sets have the following characteristics:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Change sets consist of changes that belong together and can be built and tested together.
    </li>
    <li>
        Change sets are owned by a single developer.

    Continuous integration is an implementation practice where team members integrate their work with completed&nbsp;<a class="elementLink" href="./../../../openup/guidances/concepts/change_set_430BF233.html" guid="_1QU9MAIoEdyLh7vsrHZ4YA">Change Set</a>s from other developers, and test the application, before making their
    work available to others. This&nbsp;enables detection of&nbsp;integration errors&nbsp;as&nbsp;early as possible, either
    from compiler errors,&nbsp;configuration management&nbsp;system notifications,&nbsp;or&nbsp;failures reported by the
    test suite. Ideally the integration is done automatically prior to <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../openup/guidances/guidelines/promoting_changes_9087B764.html" guid="_SM4YIL6dEdqti4GwqTkbsQ">Promoting Changes</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Continuous integration provides the following benefits:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Improved feedback. Continuous integration shows constant and demonstrable progress.
    </li>
    <li>
        Improved error detection. Continuous integration enables you to detect and address errors early, often minutes
        after they’ve been injected into the product. Effective continuous integration requires automated unit testing with
        appropriate code coverage.
    </li>
    <li>
        Improved collaboration. Continuous integration enables team members to work together safely. They know that they
        can make a change to their code, integrate the system, and determine very quickly whether or not their change
        conflicts with others.
    </li>
    <li>
        Improved system integration. By integrating continuously throughout your project you know that you can actually
        build the system, thereby mitigating integration surprises at the end of the lifecycle.
    </li>
    <li>
        Reduced&nbsp;number of parallel changes that need to be merged and tested.
    </li>
    <li>
        Reduced number of errors found during system testing. All conflicts&nbsp;are resolved prior to making new change
        sets available, by the person who is in the best position to resolve them.
    </li>
    <li>
        Reduced technical risk. You always have an up-to-date system against which to test.
    </li>
    <li>
        Reduced management risk. By continuously integrating your system you know exactly how much functionality that
        you’ve built to date, improving your ability to predict when and if you’re actually going to be able to deliver the
        necessary functionality.

    <li>
        Jane makes her changes in her workspace to both her developer tests and to the implementation, and then she tests
        the changes.
    </li>
    <li>
        Before committing the changes, Jane updates her workspace again (because other developers may have introduced
        conflicting changes) and reruns her developer tests.
    </li>
    <li>
        If these tests are successful, the changes are promoted (see <a class="elementLinkWithType"
        href="./../../../openup/guidances/guidelines/promoting_changes.html" guid="_SM4YIL6dEdqti4GwqTkbsQ">Guideline:

    </li>
    <li>
        If any of these tests fail, the team is notified, and the failed test should be addressed as soon as possible.
    </li>
    <li>
        This process repeats as the team develops and continuously integrates and tests functionality in small increments.

    Constraints
</h1>
<p>
    Conceptually, continuous integration can be performed manually (see <a class="elementLinkWithUserText"
    href="./../../../openup/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.html#SHO06" guid="_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg">[SHO06]</a>
    for example). However, in practice, there are several constraints that must be respected for it to be effective:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        All changes must be introduced into a tested configuration that you know to be good.
    </li>
    <li>
        The integrate-build-test cycle must be fast enough so that it can be completed quickly and the team notified of the
        results. Many published guidelines promote a 10-minute cycle.
    </li>
    <li>
        Keep the <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../openup/guidances/concepts/change_set.html"
        guid="_1QU9MAIoEdyLh7vsrHZ4YA">Change Set</a>s&nbsp;small enough so that the work can be completed and integration
        performed several times per day. Many published guidelines promote a 2- to 4-hour cycle between integrations.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    These constraints imply the need for a configuration management (CM) repository to maintain configuration information
    (Item 1 listed previously), automated build and test tools to meet the turnaround constraints (Item 2), and proper
    planning and discipline by developers to ensure that their work items and change sets are small enough to complete
    quickly (Item 3).

            <MainDescription><![CDATA[<p align="left">
    On small teams, shared workspaces may work fine, but you must coordinate activities between team members to avoid
    conflicts.
</p>
<p align="left">
    A better approach is for each developer to have a reasonably private area for the development and testing of their work
    products. This workspace should be insulated&nbsp;so that destabilizing or conflicting changes made by others do not
    interfere with&nbsp;progress. However, it should&nbsp;not be isolated to the extent that&nbsp;the developer''s work is
    unavailable to the team.
</p>
<p align="left">
    In addition, insulated&nbsp;workspaces can be created for each test phase, such as integration testing and system
    testing. This approach to workspaces provides several benefits <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../openup/guidances/supportingmaterials/references_6CCF393.html#WIB04" guid="_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg">[WIB04]</a>:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            Developers can develop, test, and debug software changes without being affected by others team
            members''&nbsp;changes until they are ready. When ready, developers can update their insulated environments to
            test the latest changes from other developers.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            With separate workspaces for integration and system testing, a team could use a methodology that ensures
            changes have passed integration testing before other developers get them, thereby minimizing the time spent
            solving integration problems.&nbsp; For example, if two team members check in incompatible changes without
            realizing it, and both changes are immediately available to everyone on the team, all team members&nbsp;might
            waste time trying to resolve the broken build. Conversely, if both changes must pass integration testing before
            being distributed to others, the problem could be found and fixed by one person with minimal disruption to the
            team.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            By setting up an integration area to collect and build the latest changes, the team can integrate early and
            often. That is a well-known best practice for reducing overall cost and time to deliver software projects.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            The system test area, which is used for preparing releases, is insulated from developers'' ongoing changes and
            contains only configurations that have passed integration testing. This lets you control the content of the
            release while still enabling developers to continue working.

            <MainDescription><![CDATA[<p>
    During iterative software development, the team&nbsp;creates numerous <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../openup/guidances/concepts/change_set_430BF233.html" guid="_1QU9MAIoEdyLh7vsrHZ4YA">Change Set</a>s that
    are combined into a <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../openup/workproducts/build_95D7D8FD.html" guid="_0YuXEMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">Build</a>. A build is initiated by combining the work completed by one or more
    developers and resolving any conflicts between those changes. Ideally a build is then subjected to a battery of tests
    to determine if it is of sufficient quality to move into production.
</p>
<p>
    As the changes progress from development towards production, its beneficial to know two characteristics:
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Test Context</strong>&nbsp;– identifying the elements and their versions that are tested together
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        What changes are in this build (completed work items)
    </li>
    <li>
        What&nbsp;changes are&nbsp;partially in this build (work items that are partially complete)
    </li>
    <li>
        What changes are&nbsp;not in this build (work items that are not reflected at all in this build)
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Verification Level</strong> – identifying what amount of testing is complete.&nbsp; For example,
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Unit Tested
    </li>
    <li>
        Integration Tested
    </li>
    <li>
        System Tested
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The promotion lifecycle coordinates and synchronizes the efforts of the development team. This lifecycle consists of
    the following steps:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Changes are introduced into the system in the form of completed&nbsp;<a class="elementLink" href="./../../../openup/guidances/concepts/change_set_430BF233.html" guid="_1QU9MAIoEdyLh7vsrHZ4YA">Change Set</a>s
    </li>
    <li>
        A build is generated clearly identifying the&nbsp;changes included in the build
    </li>
    <li>
        Testing is conducted
    </li>
    <li>
        When testing is successful the changes are marked with the appropriate&nbsp;verification level through labeling,
        baselining or other related techniques.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Ultimately all required testing is complete and a new system&nbsp;increment is ready.
</p>
<p>
    Separate&nbsp;<a class="elementLink" href="./../../../openup/guidances/concepts/workspace_722BBA90.html" guid="_0cEmAMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">Workspace</a>s are often used as the context for each level of testing. As changes are
    added to the <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../openup/guidances/concepts/workspace_722BBA90.html" guid="_0cEmAMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">Workspace</a>, it is verified for consistency and tested. This ensures that the effort
    of testing a build is applied to the correct&nbsp;set of changes, makes the context for the tests stable,&nbsp;and also
    allows developers to continue working on the next build while the tests are being conducted.
</p>
<p>
    A change promotion lifecycle such as this offers three key benefits
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Reduces effort because there is no reason to execute the tests in the next stages until the&nbsp;changes passes the
        previous stage. For example you would not commit the resources to&nbsp;system testing a build until it
        passes&nbsp;developer tests.
    </li>
    <li>
        Helps to ensure that a change&nbsp;which is moved into production has been subjected to the appropriate level of
        testing first.
    </li>
    <li>
        Simplifies debugging since developers can base their work on a proven&nbsp;set of changes&nbsp;in relative
        isolation from destabilizing changes from other developers
    </li>
</ol>

    Define the iteration length and use it to assess target velocity (see &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../openup/guidances/guidelines/agile_estimation.html&quot; guid=&quot;_CGHskBEdEdqY7JB6N6CW2w&quot;>Guideline: Agile&#xD;
    Estimation&lt;/a>). The number of items to be delivered in each iteration will be set by the velocity of the team and the&#xD;
    estimates for each item. The team uses the Work Items List to outline what features to implement in what iteration,&#xD;
    putting top priority work items first, including planned responses to the higher risks or opportunities.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    OpenUP organizes iterations into a set of phases. Each phase in the project lifecycle will end with a milestone aimed&#xD;

    value provided, and other aspects of the process (see &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    You don''t need to spend too much time in doing this planning. The Project plan should document only&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;a brief&#xD;
    summary of&amp;nbsp; project milestones&amp;nbsp;and 1-3 objectives for each iteration. Do not commit individual work items to&#xD;
    the plan, since this will force too much re-planning. The goal is just to create a high-level plan outlining&#xD;
    how&amp;nbsp;the team&amp;nbsp;can build the resulting application in the given set of iterations. Extra level of detail will&#xD;
    be achieved in other planning sessions throughout the project (see &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;

            <MainDescription><![CDATA[<h3>
    <font size="5">What is a Metric?</font>
</h3>
<p>
    We distinguish between measure and metric. To clarify, let’s start by defining what is meant by measure and by metric.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Measure</b>: A raw data item that is directly measured, and that will be used to calculate a metric.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Metric</b>: An interpretation of a measure or a set of measures that you use to guide your project. For example,
        recording how many test cases have passed and how many have failed are measures. Interpreting what level of quality
        this indicates and how it reflects the team''s progress within the current iteration is a metric.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    <font size="5">Why Measure?</font>
</h3>
<p>
    Measurements will mainly help you to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Communicate effectively</b>. Measurement supports effective communication among team members and project
        stakeholders.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Identify and correct problems early</b>. Measurement enables you to identify and manage potential problems early
        in the development lifecycle.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Make informed trade-offs</b>. Measurement helps objectively assess the impact of decisions, helping&nbsp;the
        team&nbsp;make trade-off decisions to best meet project goals.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Tune estimations</b>. Recording schedule, progress, and expenditures for projects will help team members to make
        more reliable estimations in the future.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    <font size="5">Potential Challenges</font>
</h3>
<p>
    There are several dangers when it comes to metrics:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <div align="left">
            <b>They can be too costly</b>. The benefit provided by the metric must exceed the cost of collecting it. Keep
            your measurements simple and easy to collect.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div align="left">
            <b>They’re a poor substitute for communication</b>. Do not use metrics as a substitute for communication. Team
            members may help to decide which metrics make sense for the project. Apply metrics not so much to control the
            project but to help team to collaborate better. Asking people about their progress is a co-dependent way of
            gaining insight into progress.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div align="left">
            <b>They can be misleading</b>. No metric or collection of metrics is perfect. Furthermore, the measurements
            upon which they are based can be manipulated by the people capturing them. Don’t rely simply upon metrics to
            manage a project.
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Effective metrics programs can be challenging to implement, though typically not because of the statistics and complex
    analysis often associated with metrics. Rather, the challenge lies in understanding which metrics add value to the
    project and to the company, and which procedures are most efficient for collecting and using these metrics.
</p>
<p>
    Consider to implement only a handful metrics. Importantly, do not collect metrics unless they help contribute to a goal
    of improving a defined area of your software development process. If you will not act on a metric, do not collect it.
    It is much more important to focus on a small number of metrics that are important to what you are trying to achieve
    right now, versus a larger set of metrics that may be "good to track".&nbsp;
</p>
<h3>
    <font size="5">Example Metrics</font>
</h3>
<p>
    Below are some common measures and associated metrics used in software development projects. These metrics help teams
    communicate, identify and correct problems early, make informed trade-offs, and tune estimations. Example metrics
    coverage areas are listed below.
</p>
<h4>
    Software quality
</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        Defect backlog: Number of defects discovered respectively resolved per iteration
    </li>
    <li>
        Test case coverage: Number of test cases executed over total number of test cases
    </li>
    <li>
        Code coverage: % of code that have been tested
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    Development productivity
</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        Velocity: Number of delivered points by iteration (see <a class="elementLink"
        href="./../../../openup/guidances/guidelines/agile_estimation.html" guid="_CGHskBEdEdqY7JB6N6CW2w">Agile
        Estimation</a>)
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    Development process effectiveness
</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        Responsiveness to quality issues: Number of defects discovered versus resolved per iteration
    </li>
    <li>
        Responsiveness to process improvement proposal: Number of process enhancements proposed versus implemented
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    Cost and schedule estimate and variance
</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        Effort: Actual effort spent per iteration
    </li>
    <li>
        Cost: Cost per iteration
    </li>
    <li>
        Effort remaining: Track <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../openup/guidances/reports/project_burndown.html"
        guid="_ePrt8Dj3EduxovfWMDsntw">Project Burndown</a>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    There are many other measures and metrics that may make sense, based on what you are trying to accomplish. As an
    example, to measure the quality of your architecture, you may for example choose to collect metrics related to coupling
    between different software packages (groups of related classes) by measuring extensibility, dependency, and
    responsibility of each package.

            <MainDescription><![CDATA[<h3>
    Agile Estimation
</h3>
<p>
    There are three main concepts you need to understand to do agile estimation, see [<a class="elementLinkWithUserText"
    href="./../../../openup/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.html#COH05" guid="_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg">COH05</a>]
    for more information:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Estimation of Size</strong> gives a high-level estimate for the work item, typically measured using a
        neutral unit such as points
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Velocity</strong> tells us how many points this project team can deliver within an iteration;
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Estimation of Effort</strong> translates the size (measured in points) to a detailed estimate of effort
        typically using the units of Actual Days or Actual Hours. The estimation of effort indicates how long it will take
        the team member(s) to complete the assigned the work item(s).
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    Estimation of Size
</h4>
<p>
    Agile estimation of size is typically done using a relative measure called <strong>points</strong>.&nbsp; The team
    decides how big a point is, and based on that size, determines how many points each work item is. To make estimation go
    fast, use only full points, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, and so on, rather than fractions of a point, such 0.25, or 1.65 points. To
    get started, look at 10 or so representative work items, give the smallest the size of one point, and then go through
    all other work items and give them a relative point estimate based on that point. Note that points are used for
    high-level estimates, so do not spend too much time on any one item. This is especially true for work items of lower
    priority, to avoid wasting effort on things that are unlikely to be addressed within the current iteration.
</p>
<p>
    A key benefit of points is that they are neutral and relative. Let’s say that Ann is 3 times more productive than Jack.
    If Ann and Jack agree that work item A is worth 1 point, and they both think work item B is roughly 5 times as big,
    they can rapidly agree that work item B is worth 5 points. Ann may however think work item B can be done in 12 hours,
    while Jack thinks it can be done in 36 hours. That is fine, they may disagree about the actual effort required to do
    it, but we do not care at this point in time, we only want the team to agree on the relative size. We will later use
    Velocity to determine how much ‘size’, or how many points, the team can take on within an iteration.
</p>
<p>
    One project team may say that a work item of a certain size is worth 1 point. Another project team would estimate the
    same sized work item to be worth 5 points. That is fine, as long as you are consistent within the same project. Make
    sure that the entire team is involved in assessing size, or at least that the same people are involved in all your size
    estimates, to ensure consistency within your project. We will see how the concept of velocity will fix also this
    discrepancy in a point meaning different things to different project teams.
</p>
<p>
    You can also use other measures of size, where the most common alternative is Ideal Days. See for example [<a
    class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../openup/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.html"
    guid="_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg">COH05</a>] for more information.
</p>
<h4>
    Velocity
</h4>
<p>
    Velocity is a key metric used for iteration planning. It indicates how many points are delivered upon within an
    iteration for a certain team and project. As an example, a team planned to accomplish 20 points in the first iteration.
    At the end of the iteration, they noticed that they only delivered upon 14 points, their velocity was hence 14. For the
    next iteration, they may plan for fewer points, let’s say 18 points, since they think they can do a little better than
    in previous iteration. In this iteration, they delivered 17 points, giving them a velocity of 17.
</p>
<p>
    Expect the velocity to change from iteration to iteration. Some iterations go smoother than others, and points are not
    always identical in terms of effort. Some team members are more effective than others, and some problems end up being
    harder than others. Also, changes to the team structure, learning new skills, changes to the tool environment, better
    teaming, or more overhead with meetings or tasks external to the project will all impact velocity. In general, velocity
    typically increases during the project as the team builds skills and becomes more cohesive.
</p>
<p>
    Velocity compensates for differences between teams in terms of how big a point is. Let’s assume that project team Alpha
    and project team Beta are equally efficient in developing software, and they run the same project in parallel. Team
    Alpha, however, assesses all work items as being worth 3 times as many points as team Beta''s estimates. Team Alpha
    assesses work item A, B, C, and D to correspond to 30 points, and team Beta estimates the same work items to correspond
    to 10 points. Both teams deliver upon those 4 work items in the next iteration, giving team Alpha a velocity of 30, and
    team Beta a velocity of 10. It may sound as if team Alpha is more effective, but let’s look at what happens when they
    plan the next iteration. They both want to take on work item E-H, which team Alpha has estimated to be 30 points, and
    team Beta as normal has estimated to be 1/3 as many points, or 10 points. Since a team can typically take on as many
    points as indicated by their velocity, they can both take on all of E-H. The end result is that it does not matter how
    big a point is, as long as you are consistent within your team.
</p>
<p>
    Velocity also averages out the efficiency of different team members. Let’s look at an example; Let’s assume that Ann
    always works 3 times as fast as Jack and Jane. Ann will perhaps deliver 9 points per iteration, and Jack and Jane 3
    points each per iteration. The velocity of that 3-person team will be 15 points. As mentioned above, Ann and Jack may
    not agree on how much effort is associated with a work item, but they can agree on how many points it is worth. Since
    the team velocity is 15, the velocity will automatically translate the point estimate to how much work can be taken on.
    As you switch team members, or as team members become more or less efficient, your velocity will change, and you can
    hence take on more or less points. This does however not require you to change the estimate of the size. The size is
    still the same, and the velocity will help you to calculate how much size you can deliver upon with the team at hand
    for that iteration.
</p>
<h4>
    Estimation of Effort
</h4>
<p>
    Estimation of Effort translates the size (measured in points) to a detailed estimate of effort typically using the
    units of Actual Days or Actual Hours. As you plan an iteration, you will take on a work item, such as detail, design,
    implement and test a scenario, which may be sized to 5 points. Since this is still a reasonably big work item, break it
    down&nbsp;into a number of smaller work items, such as 4 separate work items for Detailing, Designing, Implementing and
    Testing Server portion, and Implementing and Testing Client portion of the scenario. Team members are asked to sign up
    for the tasks, and then detail the&nbsp;estimate of the actual effort, measured in hours or days, for their tasks. In
    this case, the following actual estimates were done (with person responsible within parenthesis):
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Detailing scenario (Ann): 4 hours
    </li>
    <li>
        Designing scenario (Ann and Jack):&nbsp; 6 hours
    </li>
    <li>
        Implementing and Testing Server portion of scenario (Jack): 22 hours&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Implementing and Testing Client portion of scenario (Ann): 12 hours
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Total Effort Estimate for Scenario:</strong> 44 hours
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    If other people would be assigned to the tasks, the estimated actual hours could be quite different. There is hence no
    point doing detailed estimates until you know who will do the work, and what actual problems you will run into. Often,
    some level of analysis and design of the work item needs to take place before a reasonable estimate can be done.
    Remember that estimates are still estimates, and a person assigned to a task should feel free (and be encouraged) to
    re-estimate the effort required to complete the task, so we have a realistic view of progress within an
    iteration.<br />

    Developing the team is part of executing the project. The project manager is responsible for improving the interaction
    of team members and the trust among the team, incorporating team building into project activities and empowering the
    team to make decisions. Management is done by objectives and not by time reporting.
</p>
<p>
    The project manager helps the team to meet the iteration objectives by removing constraints and monitoring the progress
    and work remaining to completion. When the team is falling behind,&nbsp;the project&nbsp;manager&nbsp;helps the team to
    assess how it can reduce work and still meet the iteration goals. Stakeholders'' needs must be continuously met and
    their issues resolved throughout the iteration. The stakeholders may need to be involved in approving changes and
    actions that affect them.

              <Description>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The project manager needs to do the following:&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        continuously monitor the project to ensure it is progressing appropriately&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        enable the team to react as soon as possible to any change&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Many alternative means may be used to track the status. Quick, daily meetings with the entire project team are useful&#xD;
    to understand what team members have accomplished since the&amp;nbsp;last meeting, and what they plan to accomplish before&#xD;
    the next meeting. It also allows the team to identify any blocking issues. See &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;

    Meetings&lt;/a>.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Another approach is the collection of basic metrics, ideally automatically generated from the tools at hand, or&#xD;
    manually assembled. &lt;span&#xD;

    One of the project manager''s key responsibilities is to know about the project team''s problems and issues. The manager&#xD;

            <MainDescription><![CDATA[<h3>
    Introduction
</h3>
<p>
    The goal with iteration planning is to establish a few high-level objectives for what to accomplish during the
    iteration, produce a sufficiently detailed plan outlining who needs to do what to accomplish those objectives, and
    define how to assess that you accomplished what you set out to accomplish.
</p>
<p>
    Iteration planning is ideally done with the entire team in a meeting, including key stakeholders, typically lasting one
    to a few hours, at the beginning of an iteration. This ensures that the entire team understands what needs to be done,
    and they become committed to the success of the team. In some cases, it is preferred to have a smaller subset of
    people, such as the Project Manager, an Architect and an Analyst to meet in advance to prep the meeting with a draft
    iteration plan.
</p>
<h3>
    Define High-Level Objectives
</h3>
<p>
    A key aspect of an iteration is to focus the team on a short term deliverable of measurable value. Document 1-5
    high-level objectives to make sure that you don''t lose focus on what to accomplish during the iteration. Typically, the
    project plan should outline one or several objectives for each iteration, and those objectives are used as a starting
    point. If you need to further detail or clarify the objectives as you plan your iteration, do so.
</p>
<p>
    The objectives are usually based on the following factors:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Critical risks not yet mitigated:</strong> Iteration goals often include driving down the most critical
        risks.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>The time allocated to the iteration:</strong> Iterations are timeboxed, so the Project Manager must ensure
        that the goals for the iteration are realistic relative to the time and the resources allocated to the iteration.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>The highest priority features:</strong> Requirements are prioritized to ensure that the critical features
        of the application will be developed and tested early on.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    Produce an Iteration Plan
</h3>
<p>
    There is an Iteration Plan per iteration that should outline who will implement which Work Item in how long a time.
    Since iterations are time-boxed, we need to understand how big our ‘box” is by assessing how many hours of actual work
    can be taken on, see <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../../openup/guidances/guidelines/agile_estimation_A4EF42B3.html" guid="_CGHskBEdEdqY7JB6N6CW2w">Guideline: Agile Estimation</a>. Let’s assume that you have 6 team members, and you have 15 working days in your iteration, and
    you on average can do 5 actual hours of work per person and day. This will give you 6x15x5h = 450 hours of actual work.
    Note that the average team member only performs 4-6 hours of actual project work per day, with the rest being consumed
    by e-mails, meetings, and other overhead activities not directly related to the project.
</p>
<p>
    The team should then revisit and update priorities for all the high-priority items in the Work Items List, to make sure
    that an important Work Item is not missed that would otherwise fall just below the list of what can be taken on in this
    iteration.
</p>
<p>
    Pick the top-priority Work Item and see if it matches the objectives of the iteration. If it does, assess whether the
    Work Item is too big to take on within an iteration. If it is too big, break it down into smaller Work Items. Once the
    Work Item has been decomposed, the team determines whether to take on one or several child Work Items.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Example: The team would like to take on Work Item “Develop Use Case A”, but it would take roughly 300 hours to
    develop, so they feel that it is only necessary to do a subset of the use case to achieve their iteration objectives,
    allowing them to take on other high-priority Work Items. They divide the Work Item into 5 smaller work items
    representing different scenarios of use case A. The team decides to take on one out of the 5 identified scenarios in
    this iteration.</em>
</p>
<p>
    When a team has decided to take on a Work Item, it will assign the work to one or several team members. Ideally, this
    is done by team members signing up to do the work, since this makes people motivated and committed to doing the job,
    but based on culture, you may instead have the project manager assign the work.
</p>
<p>
    The next step is for team member(s) to assess how many actual hours or days it will take to do the work. Ideally, you
    want to have each work assignment to be from a few hours up to&nbsp;2 days of work. If the Work Item is too big,
    consider breaking it down into smaller Work Items.
</p>
<p>
    The team sums up the actual estimate for each Work Item they have committed to, and checks if they can commit to any
    more work.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Example: Jack signed up to develop the chosen scenario for use case A. He thinks that it would take 50 hours, so he
    decided to develop the work into a set of tasks, and he asks other team members to help out with various subtasks:</em>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <em>Detail the requirements (Jack) —5 hours</em>
    </li>
    <li>
        <em>Design the scenario (Jack, Ann, and David) —5 hours</em>
    </li>
    <li>
        <em>Implement and test the dB changes (Ann)—12 hours</em>
    </li>
    <li>
        <em>Implement and test the server portion (David)—16 hours</em>
    </li>
    <li>
        <em>Implement and test the client portion (Jack)—12 hours</em>
    </li>
    <li>
        <em>Total—50 hours</em>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    As Work Items are decomposed into smaller tasks, estimates can typically be improved. You also better come to
    understand what is involved, and whether other team member may be better suited to take on a subset of the task
</p>
<p>
    The team now determines whether they are willing to take on another Work Item by comparing actual hours signed up for
    to the actual hours available. In this case, the team has only signed up for 50 hours so far, and hence have another
    400 hours available
</p>
<h3>
    Define Evaluation Criteria
</h3>
<p>
    It is critical that it is clear to all team members and other stakeholders how you will measure success at the end of
    the iteration. Obvious success criteria should be that you can test the functionality implemented, and that no or few
    defects are detected. Having too many defects makes it impossible to use the functionality, and it will prevent
    meaningful feedback. Test objectives and test cases need to be clearly outlined.
</p>
<p>
    There may be other success criteria, such as that you demo the capabilities to a certain set of stakeholders with
    favorable review comments, or that you can successfully demonstrate or make available a tech preview at a conference.

    From a&nbsp;development perspective, each iteration provides an increment of functionality to the product. Thus, the

    objectives for that iteration have been met.

<p>
    From a management perspective, the software lifecycle&nbsp;is decomposed over time into four sequential phases, each

            <MainDescription><![CDATA[<p>
    Most iterative software development processes recommend that changes not be introduced during an iteration. The main
    idea is that the iterations should be short and with clearly defined scope so that they can be time-boxed.
</p>
<p>
    To limit scope within an iteration, change requests are reviewed and prioritized as soon as possible, but are not
    assigned for implementation until a future iteration via the <a class="elementLinkWithType"
    href="./../../../openup/workproducts/work_items_list.html" guid="_rGNWsCbSEdqh1LYUOGRh2A">Artifact: Work Items
    List</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Since iterations are relatively short this should not cause undue delay in dealing with urgent and important change
    requests.
</p>
<p>
    One notable exception is a defect discovered during testing that prevents the team from meeting the objectives of the
    iteration. In this case it is reasonable to assign the work item to the current iteration as this does not represent a
    scope change, it represents unfinished work.
</p>
<p>
    Consider the following when choosing the future iteration where the change request will be addressed:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Group similar change requests in the same iteration. For example multiple change requests focused on the same
        functionality or that are dependent on each other.
    </li>
    <li>
        Assign change requests that mitigate high risks to the earliest iteration possible.
    </li>

            <MainDescription><![CDATA[<h3>
    Introduction to Risk Management
</h3>
<p>
    Every project contains some measure of uncertainty. <strong>Risk Management</strong>&nbsp;deals with this uncertainty,
    trying to understand its&nbsp;potential influence on the project. The purpose of Risk Management is to increase the
    probability and impact of positive events and decrease the probability and impact of events adverse to the project [<a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../openup/guidances/supportingmaterials/references_6CCF393.html#PMI04" guid="_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg">PMI04</a>]. The project manager, team, and stakeholders should be involved in risk
    management.
</p>
<h3>
    Identify Risks
</h3>
<p>
    Identify risks as soon as the project starts and document them in the <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../openup/workproducts/risk_list_C4B6F290.html" guid="_Ckay8Cc_EduIsqH1Q6ZuqA">Risk List</a>.&nbsp;Continue
    identifying and managing risks throughout the project. A common mistake is to identify risks only at the beginning of
    the project and then only track the status of these initial risks. The <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../openup/workproducts/risk_list_C4B6F290.html" guid="_Ckay8Cc_EduIsqH1Q6ZuqA">Risk List</a>&nbsp; should be
    revisited weekly, or as a minimum when performing task <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../openup/tasks/plan_iteration_957C90DC.html" guid="_0keUEMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">Plan Iteration</a>, to add any
    newly discovered risks.
</p>
<h3>
    Prioritize Risks
</h3>
<p>
    Prioritize risks for further analysis or action. A good approach for prioritizing risks is to have an attribute called
    risk magnitude, a combination of the risk probability and the risk impact. Each iteration provides a chance&nbsp;for
    better understanding of stakeholder needs, the team capabilities, the technology at hand, and so on. Capture, qualify
    and prioritize risks as they arise. High magnitude risks are&nbsp;attacked first, thus&nbsp;improving the chances of
    project success and minimizing uncertainty. See <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../../openup/guidances/templates/risk_list_33A6AE1E.html" guid="_MIUO0C8FEduzydamRseoUw">Template: Risk List</a>&nbsp;for more information.
</p>
<h3>
    Select Risk Response Strategies
</h3>
<p>
    You are trying to mitigate or tackle the high priority risks as early as possible in the project. In order to achieve
    this you need to get a good grip on the risks the project is faced with, and have clear strategies on how to mitigate
    or deal with them.&nbsp; Once you have chosen a set of risks to focus on, develop options and determine actions to
    enhance opportunities and reduce threats, selecting a strategy, as described in <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../../openup/guidances/concepts/risk_AF5840DA.html" guid="_0bsLgMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">Concept: Risk</a>. Sometimes
    strategies can be determined for each cause, rather than each risk, eliminating many risks at once.
</p>
<h3>
    Plan Risk Response
</h3>
<p>
    For each selected strategy, identify and assign tasks to apply the strategy to the given risk. Place those tasks on the
    <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../openup/workproducts/work_items_list_39D03CC8.html" guid="_rGNWsCbSEdqh1LYUOGRh2A">Work Items List</a>&nbsp;so they can be assigned to iterations. Keep a&nbsp;reference to
    the risk for traceability. The effort must be appropriate to the magniture of the risk. Avoid spending more preventing
    a threat than the impact from the risk if it occurs.
</p>
<h3>
    Monitor Risks
</h3>
<p id="comment_text_4">
    Follow up regularly on risk-mitigation/enhancing actions. Risk reviews should be held&nbsp;when performing task <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../openup/tasks/assess_results_EC34D88D.html" guid="_0l53cMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">Assess Results</a>&nbsp;to determine whether the information about project risks is up to date, and to assess whether any
    changes are necessary. The team may decide to try another strategy if the chosen strategy does not reduce/increase the
    magnitude of a risk.

            <MainDescription><![CDATA[<p>
    The iteration burndown report is&nbsp;the primary tool for understanding the status of the current iteration. It shows
    the trend for how much work is left to do within the iteration. This is accomplished by adding the estimated effort
    left for each of the Work Items to be addressed within the iteration and showing how the estimated effort is changing
    over the duration of the iteration. The iteration backlog should be updated frequently, preferably daily.
</p>
<p>
    These factors affect the team’s assessment of how much work remains:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Work that has been completed, which means there is less work remaining.
    </li>
    <li>
        The developer responsible for a Work Item changes the assessment of effort required to complete the Work Item. This
        should be expected, because we typically understand what it really takes to complete a task after we have done a
        subset of the task.&nbsp;It''s common for estimates of the work remaining to increase in the beginning of the
        iteration, especially for inexperienced teams, because they often underestimate efforts. Expect estimates to
        continue changing as teams become more experienced, but the modifications are upward as often as downward.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Daily or frequent updates of the iteration burndown report allow the team to react to changes. For example, changes can
    include cutting the project scope by removing Work Items from the iteration, reducing the ambition level associated
    with a Work Item, or finding better ways of approaching Work Items, such as having an expert team member help with
    difficult Work Items.

    The project burndown report is a primary tool for understanding the status of a project. It shows the trend for how
    much work is left to do within that project. This is done by adding the estimated effort left for each of the Work
    Items to be addressed within the project and showing how the estimated effort is changing from iteration to iteration.
    The project burndown report should be updated at the end of each iteration.
</p>
<p>
    The project burndown rate is usually communicated in graphical form.&nbsp;The project burndown chart consists of two
    perspectives, with the horizontal axis showing the iterations and the vertical axis indicating the remaining points
    from the Work Items List. Additionally, the average burndown rate from previous iterations is calculated, and a trend
    for the remainder of the project forecasted from that historical data.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    Project burndown management is a enabling technique that allows direct linkage of iteration goals to Work Items. The
    Project Manager will use the project burndown information for communicating progress and trends to senior management.

            <MainDescription><![CDATA[<p>
    Retrospectives, as applied in software development, have historical roots in Project Retrospectives described as:
</p>
<blockquote>
        "A ritual held <b>at the end</b> of a project to learn from the experience and plan changes for the next
        effort." [<a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../openup/guidances/supportingmaterials/references_6CCF393.html#KER01" guid="_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg">KER01</a>]
</blockquote>
<p>
    While Retrospectives conducted at the end of a project remain valuable, the spirit of Retrospectives should be imbued
    across the project continuum, conducted at key project milestones: at the end of project iterations, releases, and
    immediately upon occurrences of key project incidents (significant unexpected events). 
</p>	
<p>	
	When the practice of
    Retrospectives is intimately intertwined with the processes of the project, the health of the team is constantly
    monitored, the heartbeat of project progress is readily measured, and the team hones an awareness of opportunities for
    improvement and increased productivity. A symbiotic relationship emerges between an evolutionary development process
    and a Retrospective that supports the various methods of inspection and adaptation.
</p>
<p>
    The iteration, incident, and project Retrospectives are designed, in part, to calibrate the team''s progress with the
    goals of the project. Several methods can be used to incite the Retrospective team to begin their collective
    investigative work, such as posing the following three driving questions to the team: "What worked well for us during
    the past iteration (or project, and so on)?", "What did not work well for us during the past iteration (or project, and so on)?",
    and "What should we do differently, or what improvements should we undertake during our next iteration (or project, and so on)". 
</p>	
<p>	
	The questions are expected to generate actions that will assist the team in prioritizing suggested improvements
    for the project, to be implemented during the subsequent cycle. In addition to the aforementioned investigative
    questions, a Retrospective should include steps that provide structure for the team''s focus and resulting work.
</p>
<p>
    An effectively facilitated Retrospective will create an environment that is conducive to various practices of
    inspection and adaptation. The methods of inspection and adaptation are project control mechanisms that assume, and
    respond to, the existence of complexity, unpredictability, and constant change. Practiced in the context of a
    Retrospective, the methods of inspection and adaptation produce a feedback loop from which flexibility, responsiveness,
    and reliability are realized.
</p>
<p>
    The mere execution of Retrospectives is insufficient without an organizational commitment to a collaborative culture.
    The success of Retrospectives is directly proportional to, and necessarily contingent on, an environment that engenders
    highly motivated and performing teams (not the individual), nurtures open and frequent communication, and a thriving
    sense of dedication to the team community. Retrospectives embody the spirit of team collaboration and self-reflection
    by offering an environment in which teams are encouraged to provide feedback and identify lessons learned [<a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../openup/guidances/supportingmaterials/references_6CCF393.html#DER06" guid="_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg">DER06</a>]. The compositional aspects of the team are crucial in supporting the highly
    collaborative nature of Retrospectives, enabling the team to produce insight(s) into improving the processes of the
    project.
</p>
<p>
    The participants that gather in the context of a Retrospective constitute more than a "working group".
    The participants should be thought of as "a small number of people with complementary skills who are committed to
    a common purpose, performance goals, and approach for which they hold themselves mutually accountable." [<a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../openup/guidances/supportingmaterials/references_6CCF393.html#KAT93" guid="_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg">KAT93</a>]
</p>
<p>
    The participants should consist of individuals representing cross-functional groups, having been involved in the
    project period or project incident for which the Retrospective will be conducted. The size of the team is important,
    for the rigorously participative environment of the Retrospective may be difficult to achieve with an overwhelmingly
    large group (25+ individuals), and a time-boxed period in which to conduct the Retrospective. Conversely, a
    small set of participants that is under-represented by the appropriate functional groups will limit the
    benefits and productivity of team collaboration and self-organization. Although a Retrospective achieves productive
    results by actualizing team responsibility, self-organization, and opposing traditional imposing authority, the work
    conducted in a Retrospective - involving the members of cross-functional groups - demands the presence of a designated
    facilitator.
</p>
<p>
    The individual that is designated to assume the role of facilitator, or Retrospective leader, should possess
    fundamental skills of a facilitative management approach:
</p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    <p class="quote">
        "A facilitator is an individual who enables groups and organizations to work more effectively; to collaborate and
        achieve synergy. She or he is a "content neutral" party who by not taking sides or expressing or advocating a point
        of view during the meeting, can advocate for fair, open, and inclusive procedures to accomplish the group''s work. A
        facilitator can also be a learning or dialogue guide to assist a group in thinking deeply about its assumptions,
        beliefs and values and about its systemic processes and context." [<a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../openup/guidances/supportingmaterials/references_6CCF393.html#KAN96" guid="_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg">KAN96</a>]
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
    The facilitator can be expected to allow the participants to exercise a sense of ownership in the operating mode of
    thought, act to remove impediments to the team''s effort to reach targeted goals, foster an environment of trust and
    thriving collaboration, and support the team in a manner that allows the team to achieve its best thinking. Ultimately,
    the facilitator focuses on managing the format of the Retrospective, while the participants hone their skills in
    managing the Retrospective content and maintaining a high-performance, participatory group dynamic.

<ul>
    
  <li><b> Iteration: </b>2 to 4 hours </li>
  <li><b> Incident: </b>15 to 45 minutes </li>
  <li> <b>Project: </b>1 to several days </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Select the facilitator of the Retrospective (See <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../../openup/guidances/concepts/retrospective_B003F386.html" guid="_2PfbIA4QEdy2q5zsU8WDnA">Concept: Retrospective</a> for more detail on the facilitator).
</p>
<p> If the team is gathering to conduct the first Retrospective, the group will 
  need to create the cultural norms that will be used in the future Retrospectives. 
  If the team is regrouping to conduct a Retrospective, the existing cultural 
  norms will be used. Norm Kerth’s Prime Directive is an excellent and widely 
  referenced guiding principle for each Retrospective: </p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    
  <p class="quote"> <strong>Prime Directive</strong>: “Regardless of what we discover, we understand 
    and truly believe that everyone did the best job they could, given what they 
    knew at the time, their skills and abilities, the resources available, and 
    the situation at hand.” [<a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../openup/guidances/supportingmaterials/references_6CCF393.html#KER01" guid="_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg">KER01</a>] 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p> Remind the team that the Prime Directive and cultural norms of the Retrospective 
  are in place to establish an environment in which the members can safely expose 
  sensitive topics and manage meaningful, if provocative, dialogue. The cultural 
  norms guide the team by a “social contract” that clearly outlines the “team 
  values and working agreements” that have been established by the team. The social 
  contract needs to include organizational value statements that govern acceptable 
  behavior and interactions, supplemented by inviolable principles that govern 
  the conduct and ethics of the team. The team must establish these rules of group 
  engagement before the Retrospective continues to the core of the group’s intended 
  gathering. Examples of working agreements include: tardiness is not acceptable; 
  mobile phones must be powered off during the session; all participants must 
  be in attendance throughout the duration of the Retrospective or ask permission 
  from the group for early departure; all opinions are welcome; the team must 
  strive for healthy, high-quality interaction. </p>
<p> The team’s working agreements (and&nbsp;the Prime Directive statement) should 
  be displayed prominently in the Retrospective session, so that they are clearly 
  visible to all members of the team and, if required, easily accessible so that 
  the team can edit the content. After it is defined, future Retrospectives can 
  begin with a review of these working agreements. </p>
<p> After the team has established a safe environment in which to conduct the 
  Retrospective, the facilitator of the Retrospective should elicit participation 
  from the group, thereby granting tacit permission to members who are hesitant 
  to participate immediately. </p>
<h1> Collect and analyze data </h1>
<p> The team begins this step of the Retrospective with a review of the meaningful 
  characteristics of the iteration, release, incident, or project period. The 
  focus of the team’s work in this step includes: critical developments, notable 
  discoveries, work completed, project metrics (velocity, number of defects, and 
  so forth), and review of project artifacts (requirements artifacts, project 
  plans, and such). Encourage the team to capture all information (project data, 
  opinions, and so on) by using various tools (white boards, charts, timelines) 
  that provide a visual representation so that the team can identify relationships 
  and emerging patterns. </p>
<p> The team uses guiding questions to collect and analyze meaningful project 
  data. You can use these examples of key questions to elicit relevant information: 
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Were the defined goals and objectives met? Did the release meet its functionality and quality goals? Did the
        release meet performance and capacity goals?
    </li>
    <li>
        Were risks reduced or eliminated? Can we identify new risks?
    </li>
  <li> Were all planned work items addressed? What was the team’s velocity relative 
    to the plan? </li>
    <li>
        Did the end users provide favorable feedback on what we built in this iteration?
    </li>
    <li>
        Are changes to the project plan required?
    </li>
  <li> What portion of the current release will be used to establish the baseline? 
    What portion will need to be reworked? </li>
  <li> Have there been external changes, such as changes in the marketplace, in 
    the user community, or in the requirements? </li>
  <li> Was the development process appropriate? How can it be fine-tuned for the 
    specific needs of this project? </li>
</ul>
<p> The team has generated a list of candidate topics to focus on for its collective 
  inquiry, or heightened analysis. The team’s methods of analysis need to facilitate 
  a deepening understanding of the events characterizing the iteration, incident, 
  release, or Project Retrospective. The team will be evaluating these driving 
  factors, which ultimately documents a roadmap for the next cycle: </p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Success: </b>“What worked well for us during the past iteration (or project 
    or phase)?”</li>
  <li><b>Failure: </b>“What did not work well for us during the past iteration 
    [or project or phase)?”</li>
  <li><b>Opportunities for improvement: </b>“What should we do differently, or 
    what improvements should we undertake during our next iteration (or project 
    or phase)?”</li>
</ul>
<p> With increasing emphasis, the thread of team collaboration continues throughout 
  the Retrospective, thereby fostering an environment conducive to candid, unimpeded 
  examination by the team -- a rigorous style of examination that will be required 
  to unearth the details lurking in the interactions of the team, the conditions 
  of the project, fortuitous events, failures, risks, and examples of flourishing 
  success. </p>
<p> After the team has collected and analyzed the key data in the Retrospective, 
  the team will have evaluated key project content. For each item evaluated, they 
  will have established a root cause. The team will know what worked well, what 
  did not, and what to do differently this time, so they can carry forward a list 
  of suggested improvements that will be prioritized by the team. </p>
<h1> Set priorities</h1>
<p> By referencing the project data collected and analyzed in the Retrospective, 
  the team now creates a list of suggested improvements, assigning a priority 
  to each item on the list. </p>
<p> The selection of improvements should be limited to a subset that will be applied 
  in the next iteration cycle. This list should be considered as input to update 
  the next Iteration Plan, so you can ensure an integrated relationship between 
  the changes identified in the Retrospective and the normal course of the team’s 
  work plans. </p>
<p> Get commitment from members to complete, the suggested improvements that have 
  been chosen for application in the next iteration cycle. The visibility and 
  commitment among the members of the team imbue a sense that the Retrospective 
  was worthy of the team’s investment of time and that the results of the work 
  on the Retrospective will be tracked in the next iteration cycle. </p>
<p> Maintain a backlog of the suggested improvements that were not chosen for 
  the next iteration cycle. This will preserve the work of the Retrospective. 
  The selected content will be available for convenient access and monitoring 
  for progress, and the unselected items will be available for consideration during 
  future iteration cycles. </p>
<h1> Conclude and document the process</h1>
<p>
    The team’s honed methods of investigation and analysis&nbsp;are now applied to the Retrospective itself. During the
    evaluation of the Retrospective, the team considers the moments of empowering thought and interaction, considers ideas
    for improving future Retrospectives, revisits the team’s social contract, extends appreciation throughout the group,
    and preserves the discoveries of the team (for example,&nbsp;through the use of Retrospective documentation
    or&nbsp;pictures from a digital camera taken during the Retrospective).

            <MainDescription><![CDATA[<p>
    A "self organizing team" has the authority to choose the work that it will perform and the responsibility to do that
    work in the way that it chooses.&nbsp; Important aspects of a self organizing team&nbsp;are:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        The team selects its own work. At the beginning of an iteration the team collectively selects the <a href="./../../../openup/guidances/termdefinitions/work_item_EE5CE155.html" guid="_jyVgcEvKEdunZcj9T5hrMQ">work item</a>s from the prioritized <a href="./../../../openup/workproducts/work_items_list_39D03CC8.html" guid="_rGNWsCbSEdqh1LYUOGRh2A">Work Items List</a>. Work selection is performed within given constraints, including
        the priorities set by <a href="./../../../openup/roles/stakeholder_9FFD4106.html" guid="_dTa6gMAYEdqX-s4mWhkyqQ">Stakeholder</a>s, time (such as the length of the current <a href="./../../../openup/guidances/concepts/iteration_C20B1904.html" guid="_lam4ADkBEduxovfWMDsntw">Iteration</a>), the budget, and the skills of team members.
    </li>
    <li>
        Individuals select their own work. Individuals are empowered to select their own work. Someone will choose to do
        something because they are good at it and know that they can do the work effectively, because they want to gain
        more experience at something and hope to improve their skill-set by working with someone with such experience, or
        because they know that the work needs to be done and that it''s their turn to do so. Although an individual fulfills
        one or more roles on a project team that doesn''t imply that the person is constrained to only doing specific types
        of work.
    </li>
    <li>
        The team determines how to perform the work. At the beginning of an iteration the team will hold an "all hands"
        planning meeting where it determines the general strategy for doing the work and the tasks required to do so. More
        detailed planning, if required, will be done on a just-in-time (JIT) basis by the individual(s) doing the work.
        Note that the team is still constrained by your organization''s standards, technical infrastructure, regulations,
        and so on.
    </li>
    <li>
        Everyone commits to the work. The team commits to accomplishing the work that it has agreed to do by the end of the
        iteration. Individuals also commit to doing the work that they say they will do, although as the iteration
        progresses various tasks may be renegotiated as required.
    </li>
    <li>
        The team coordinates regularly. To ensure that the work is accomplished the team must coordinate its efforts
        effectively. This is typically done through daily stand up meetings of the team and impromptu discussions between
        individuals.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    This is a participatory approach to decision making where everyone has the opportunity to provide input and to listen
    to the decision making process. The goal is to make decisions at the right place within the organizational structure,
    empowering teams by giving them both the responsibility and the authority to get the job done. It improves motivation
    amongst team members, and thereby their productivity, by giving them control over their work.
</p>
<h3>
    Project Manager Responsibilities
</h3>
<p>
    There is still work for the <a href="./../../../openup/roles/project_manager_E657F936.html" guid="_0a0o0MlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">Project Manager</a> on self organizing teams. The project manager must still:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Provide leadership. Team culture and project vision must be nurtured and evolved throughout the project, and
        direction must be provided to the team.
    </li>
    <li>
        Mediate disagreements. The manager must be prepared to step in and make a decision when other team members are
        unable to come to a decision.
    </li>
    <li>
        Ensure that team members grow their skill-set. From time to time the manager may need to motivate individuals to
        take on new tasks that are outside their comfort zone or to work with others to help those people gain new skills.
    </li>
    <li>
        Ensure that the team respects their limits. Self organizing teams have the authority to make decisions within the
        scope of their responsibility, but that doesn''t mean that they get to rethink everything that they feel like. For
        example, the development team must still conform to the technical infrastructure and to the business strategy of
        your organization: they likely don''t have the authority to change these things even though they may not fully agree
        with them. When an issue falls outside their scope of responsibility the team must either accept it or collaborate
        with the people with the appropriate authority.
    </li>
    <li>
        Summarize the project plan. External stakeholders, such as senior management or business representatives not
        actively involved with the team, will want to know the current status of the project and the team''s current plans.
        The project manager may be required to summarize and communicate this information to those people.
    </li>
</ol>
<h3>
    What This Isn''t
</h3>
<p>
    The concept of self organizing teams often sounds like anarchy or non-management to traditional IT professionals, but
    nothing could be further from the truth. Although self organization relies on team members being responsible and mature
    it is tempered by the guiding hand of a good project manager. It is also tempered by organizational standards,
    infrastructure, and external regulations. "Self organizing" doesn''t mean that you have complete freedom to do what you
    want.
</p>
<p>
    Self organization isn''t necessarily a consensus-based approach either; sometimes individuals will disagree with a
    decision but will choose to go along with the will of the team. Nevertheless, consensus isn''t ruled out by this
    approach but it certainly isn''t required.

            <MainDescription><![CDATA[<p>
    Good software development teams are made up of a collection of people who collaborate effectively. How the project team
    is staffed, by either adding or removing people, will greatly impact the team''s productivity.
</p>
<p>
    When staffing a development project, consider the following advice:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Include people who fit into the existing team culture. Good teams don''t just appear magically one day, but instead
        are grown and nurtured over time. Invite people onto the team who will add value and furthermore who will not be
        disruptive. Similarly, you may need to invite someone to leave the team if they do not fit well with the existing
        team and they don''t seem to be able to change.
    </li>
    <li>
        People should want to be on the team. People are far more productive when they''re working on a project that they
        believe in and want to see succeed.
    </li>
    <li>
        Build your team with "generalizing specialists". A generalizing specialist is someone with one or more technical
        specialties who actively seeks to gain new skills in both their existing specialties as well as in other areas,
        including both technical and domain areas. Generalizing specialists add value to the team because they have
        specialized skills that you need while at the same time appreciate the full range of issues that a general
        understanding of the software development process and the business domain offers.
    </li>
    <li>
        Include stakeholders. Stakeholders, including business stakeholders such as end users and technical stakeholders
        such as operations staff, can add significant value to your team. Instead of just interviewing them to gain
        information from them, or asking them to review your work, why not include them as active participants on the team?
    </li>
    <li>
        Include specialists for short-term, specialized work. Specialists can still add value on an agile development team,
        particularly when they have specific skills and experience which existing team members do not have. It can often be
        more effective to bring a specialist into the team for a short period of time to help with a specific task, such as
        installation and setup of an application server, the development of an architectural spike, or simply taking part
        in a review.
    </li>
    <li>
        Give people opportunities to evolve their skills. At the beginning of a project the team may not have the full
        range of skills that it needs, or perhaps a few individuals may not have the skills required to fulfill the roles
        they are filling. This is a very common risk taken on by the majority of project teams for the simple reasons that
        you often can''t find the perfect combination of people and even if you could you still want to provide people with
        opportunities to grow as professionals.
    </li>
    <li>
        Remember Brook''s Law. Adding people to a late project will only make it later [<a href="./../../../openup/guidances/supportingmaterials/references_6CCF393.html" guid="_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg">BRO87</a>]. The corollary is that removing people from a late project may speed
        things up [<a href="./../../../openup/guidances/supportingmaterials/references_6CCF393.html" guid="_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg">AMB04</a>].
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    Sometimes you will need to go against some of this advice due to environmental constraints. Perhaps only specialists
    are available (although there''s nothing stopping a specialist from becoming a generalizing specialist), perhaps there
    aren''t as many opportunities for people to try new things as they would like, or perhaps the stakeholders aren''t
    available to be active members of the team. The advice above is designed to lead to as high-performing a team as
    possible, but even partial adherence to this guideline will improve the team.

            <MainDescription><![CDATA[<h3>
    Practices
</h3>
<p>
    Daily meetings are the heartbeat of the project. All team members are required to attend&nbsp;it. The meetings are held
    in the same place at the same time every work day and should&nbsp;not last for more than 15 minutes. Usually, teams do
    the meetings standing up to keep them short. Anyone who is directly involved&nbsp;can also attend the meeting as an
    observer, but care should be taken because too many people in the meeting may cause disruption or cause people to be
    uncomfortable in sharing information. Typical daily meetings should have at most 10 people.
</p>During the daily meeting, each team member updates their peers with answers to the following three questions <a
class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../openup/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.html#SCH04"
guid="_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg">[SCH04]</a>: 
<ol>
    <li>
        What did I do yesterday?
    </li>
    <li>
        What will I do today?
    </li>
    <li>
        What is impeding my work?
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    These 3 questions have a specific purpose [<a class="elementLinkWithUserText"
    href="./../../../openup/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.html#SUT06" guid="_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg">SUT06</a>]:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The first question tests the focus of the team - anything done that was not work planned for the iteration is
        questioned.
    </li>
    <li>
        Answering the second question revises project strategy on a daily basis by reorienting the team due to dependency
        changes that were revealed by the previous question.
    </li>
    <li>
        The third question will create issues that may result in new tasks in the work items list. The most important
        effect of this question is to create a list of issues that are assigned to the team or to managers.&nbsp;The team
        should expect management to help eliminating bottlenecks.&nbsp;
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    These are the minimum number of questions that satisfy the goals of daily meetings. Experienced practitioners tend to
    add an additional question for improving collaboration among team members: "What have I learned or decided of relevance
    to the team?" [<a class="elementLinkWithUserText"
    href="./../../../openup/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.html#LAR03"
    guid="_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg">LAR03</a>].&nbsp;“What might help or hinder others in meeting their commitments?” [<a
    class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../openup/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.html#YIP"
    guid="_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg">YIP</a>]. Other topics of discussion (<i>e.g.</i>, design discussions, gossip, etc.)
    should be deferred until after the meeting.
</p>
<h3>
    Value
</h3>
<p>
    For self-directed teams, the daily meeting is a mechanism to quickly inform the team about the state of the project and
    people. It supports openness and allows resolution of dependencies and conflicts in real-time. It builds a team -
    effective teams are built by regularly communicating, sharing commitments and helping each other. [<a
    class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../openup/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.html#LAR03"
    guid="_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg">LAR03</a>]<br />
    <br />
</p>
<h3>
    What a daily meeting is not
</h3>
<p>
    The daily meeting is not a status update meeting in which the project manager is collecting information about who is
    behind schedule. Rather, it is a meeting in which team members make commitments to each other.<br />
    <br />
    Neither is it a problem-solving or issue resolution meeting. Issues that are raised are registered and usually dealt
    with by the relevant team members immediately afterwards. It is the project manager''s responsibility to resolve them as
    quickly as possible or to make sure that someone on the team does so.

    Planning Transition Iterations
</h3>
<p>
    Software may be deployed into a production environment at the end of any Construction or Transition iteration.
    Deployment to production before the end of the project may be done to drive down risk by validating the application,
    deployment scripts, the deployment environment, and to get valuable feedback from operations and systems teams, as well
    as end user. These early deployments are often done on a limited scale in terms of target audience or deployment of
    only partial applications. For the deployment to work, one or several iterations are focused on work necessary to
    successfully release the system. In Transition, one or several iterations may be dedicated to preparing for a smooth
    deployment. The number of iterations depends on the complexity of the system and various other factors, as listed
    below. When planning for deployment, the work item list should be updated with relevant tasks related to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Resolving defects
    </li>
    <li>
        Testing installation or deployment scripts to avoid surprises in actual deployment&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Updating any&nbsp;operations&nbsp;&amp; support test environments used to simulate production problems
    </li>
    <li>
        Performing release-specific testing efforts such as pilot or beta testing to a subset of your end-user community
        where the system is deployed
    </li>
    <li>
        Conducting acceptance reviews with stakeholders, including a&nbsp;final release acceptance testing effort where
        people outside of the team are involved and decide whether it truly meets their needs
    </li>
    <li>
        Finalizing relevant documentation, such as operations and system manuals, end-user documentation and release notes
    </li>
    <li>
        Creating&nbsp;physical collateral, such as installation media
    </li>
    <li>
        Replacing and/or installing physical assets, including workstations, servers, and network components
    </li>
    <li>
        Replacing existing software with new versions
    </li>
    <li>
        Updating existing databases, including any relevant data migration and/or database schema changes
    </li>
    <li>
        Production data population
    </li>
    <li>
        Training end users and operations&nbsp;and support staff

<p>
    Transition iteration reviews have a different focus from other iterations in the project lifecycle. The goal is not to
    brainstorm around what&nbsp;features to develop next. Instead, reviews will assess the release management resources and
    procedures, the quality of the software,&nbsp;and how prepared users and operations teams are to face a move of the
    software into the production environment.

            <MainDescription><![CDATA[<h3>
    Practice
</h3>An iteration assessment is a short meeting (up to 4 hours) involving the team and stakeholders that uses the solution
increment as the focal point for brainstorming and to consider what functionality might be added in the next Iteration. It
is a low ceremony meeting so the team should not waste too much time preparing the demo and formal presentations.
Preparations can, instead, be focused on making the demo fast-paced and thinking about a good story to present the
scenarios planned for the demo [<a class="elementLinkWithUserText"
href="./../../../openup/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.html#STZ07"
guid="_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg">STZ07</a>].<br />
<br />
The team should start the meeting by reviewing the iteration goal before presenting&nbsp;the functionality. The demo should
be kept at a business-oriented level, leaving out the technical details. It should be focused on what was
accomplished&nbsp;rather than how it was done. If possible, the audience should try to use the product. Minor bug fixes and
trivial features should not be demonstrated, just mentioned, because the audience&nbsp;may lose focus on more important
scenarios. Functionality that isn''t <span style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: rgb(255,255,255)">really done (acceptance
tested)</span>&nbsp;should not&nbsp;be presented. <br />
<br />
Team members present the system functionality and answer stakeholder questions. They also record changes, missing
functionality and&nbsp;ideas for new features in the work item list. At the end of the presentation, the stakeholders are
asked for their impressions and the priority of the changes. The potential rearrangement of the work items list is
discussed with the team. Other points of discussion may include:<br />
<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        Were the defined goals and objectives met? Did the release meet its functionality and quality goals? Did the
        release meet performance and capacity goals?
    </li>
    <li>
        Were risks reduced or eliminated?&nbsp;Were new risks&nbsp;identified?
    </li>
    <li>
        Were all planned work items addressed? What was the team''s velocity relative to plan?
    </li>
    <li>
        Did the end-users provide favorable feedback on what was built in this iteration?
    </li>
    <li>
        Are any changes to the project plan required?
    </li>
    <li>
        What portion of the current release will be baselined? What portion will need to be reworked?
    </li>
    <li>
        Have there been external changes such as changes in the marketplace, in the user community, or in the requirements,
        that will affect the project plan?
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Stakeholders and the team may also agree that there is sufficient functionality in the system to provide immediate
    business value and they may decide to put the solution into production. In that case, discuss what deployment-related
    work items should be added to the work items list. For more information see <a class="elementLinkWithType"

    Solution</a>.
</p>
<h3>
    Value
</h3>
<p>
    The Iteration Assessment provides an opportunity for everybody to learn about the solution being built and obtain vital
    feedback from stakeholders. It also forces the team to actually finish work and release it.

            <MainDescription><![CDATA[<h3>
    What Is Prioritized?
</h3>
<p>
    Work items are used to prioritize among others:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        enhancement requests and requirements at a level of abstraction appropriate for stakeholders prioritization, such
        as use cases and scenarios,
    </li>
    <li>
        project tasks, such as setting up required infrastructure,
    </li>
    <li>
        defects,
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    or any other work that needs to be prioritized. The <a class="elementLink"
    href="./../../../openup/workproducts/work_items_list.html" guid="_rGNWsCbSEdqh1LYUOGRh2A">Work Items List</a> hence
    provides us with one place for prioritizing work. Prioritizing too small units of work may lead to analysis-paralysis.
</p>
<h3>
    Who Prioritizes?
</h3>
<p>
    Prioritization is done by the extended team. Here are some examples on how different team members contribute to the
    prioritization:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../openup/roles/analyst.html" guid="_0VxJsMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">Analyst</a>s
        collaborate with stakeholders to establish the initial priorities for work items to implement, such as features,

    <li>
        <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../openup/roles/architect.html" guid="_0X9iEMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">Architect</a>s
        collaborate with stakeholders and development team to identify the architecturally significant use cases and
        scenarios, and re-prioritizes these so the team understands what needs to be done to drive down technical risk and
        to progress the evolution of the product in a technically sensible fashion.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../openup/roles/developer.html" guid="_0YDosMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">Developer</a>s

        planning an iteration, and managing an iteration to ensure smooth execution, and that the perspectives of all team
        members are properly heard. When the team cannot gain consensus in a reasonable time, the project manager has final
        say on the priority of work items to small to warrant the attention of the paying stakeholder(s).
    </li>

        <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../openup/roles/stakeholder.html"
        guid="_dTa6gMAYEdqX-s4mWhkyqQ">Stakeholder</a>s that pay for the application has the final say on what capabilities
        to prioritize.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    When Do You Prioritize?
</h3>
<p>
    When you put in a new work item in a <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../openup/workproducts/work_items_list.html"
    guid="_rGNWsCbSEdqh1LYUOGRh2A">Work Items List</a>, you should give it an initial priority. Priorities are always
    changing, and below we describe what (re-)prioritization is done when Planning a Project, Planning an Iteration, and
    Managing an Iteration.
</p>
<h4>
    Prioritizing When Planning a Project
</h4>
<p>
    When planning the project, see <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../openup/tasks/plan_the_project.html"
    guid="_0lC70MlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">Plan Project</a>, key features, use cases, and scenarios are prioritized and potentially
    assigned to iterations as a part of laying out the project plan and what should be done when. These prioritizes will be
    revised later on as iterations are planned.
</p>
<p>
    When starting a project where we enhance an existing application, we may have an existing work items list from past
    projects and usage of the application. If this is the case, we go through the work items list to survey and
    re-prioritize existing work items, so we understand which to focus on.
</p>
<h4>
    Prioritizing When Planning an Iteration
</h4>
<p>
    When planning what to deliver for an iteration, see <a class="elementLink"
    href="./../../../openup/tasks/plan_iteration.html" guid="_0keUEMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">Plan Iteration</a>, the team needs to
    balance what delivers immediate value to the stakeholders with mitigating risk, see <a class="elementLink"
    href="./../../../openup/guidances/concepts/project_lifecycle.html" guid="_nSfVwCNYEdyCq8v2ZO4QcA">Project
    Lifecycle</a>. The chosen balance should be reflected in the iteration objectives, which are then driving further
    prioritization and assignments of work items to the next iteration. This exercise should be done by the entire team to
    reflect all key perspectives, such as technical (“doing A before B saves you time”), managerial (“we do not have
    anybody that knows that legacy application until next iteration”, or business (“this scenario is more important than
    that scenario”).
</p>
<h4>
    Prioritizing When Managing an Iteration
</h4>
<p>
    We recommend against expanding or changing the scope of an iteration, see <a class="elementLink"
    href="./../../../openup/tasks/manage_iteration.html" guid="_8S2aICbYEdqh1LYUOGRh2A">Manage Iteration</a>, since this
    will almost certainly lead to scope creep, and potentially confusion among the team what to work on. This means that as
    you can up with new enhancement requests, you should capture them to a work item, but not assign them to the current
    iteration.
</p>
<p>
    During an iteration, you are developing and testing code. As you develop solution increments, you will find defects. In
    most cases, you will directly fix the defect since it is trivial, best done by you, and should be fixed now. Examples
    of such defects are the many problems you find as you implement your code using a test-driven development approach. In
    other cases, the defect should captured as a work item. This allows it to be prioritized, potentially developed by
    somebody else and at a different time. If a defect needs to be addressed to provide an iteration build of reasonable
    quality that addresses the iteration objectives, it should be addressed to the current iteration. Note that this is not
    a creep or change of scope, since it merely indicates that we need to fix something to deliver what we already
    committed to.
</p>
<h3>
    How Do You Prioritize
</h3>
<p>
    Prioritizing is the difficult balancing of frequently competing priorities. For more information on the art of
    prioritizing, see for example [<a class="elementLinkWithUserText"

              <MainDescription><![CDATA[<p>
    This activity describes the tasks you perform to gather, specify, analyze, and validate a subset of the system''s
    requirements prior to implementation and verification. This does not imply that all requirements are detailed prior to
    commencing implementation. Rather, this activity is performed throughout the lifecycle with <a class="elementLink" href="./../../openup/roles/stakeholder_9FFD4106.html" guid="_dTa6gMAYEdqX-s4mWhkyqQ">Stakeholder</a>s and the entire
    development team collaborating to ensure that a clear, consistent, correct, verifiable, and feasible set of
    requirements is available, as needed, to drive implementation and verification.
</p>
<p>
    During Inception, the focus is on gaining agreement regarding the problem to be solved, gathering stakeholder needs,
    and capturing high-level system features (see activity <a class="elementLink" href="./../../openup/capabilitypatterns/initiate_project_D9C03857.html" guid="_0pWNA8lgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">Initiate project</a>).
</p>
<p>
    During Elaboration, the focus shifts to defining the solution. This consists of finding those requirements that have
    most value to stakeholders, that are particularly challenging or risky, or that are architecturally significant (See <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../openup/tasks/find_and_outline_requirements_90D272B9.html" guid="_P9cMUPV_EdmdHa9MmVPgqQ">Task: Find and Outline Requirements</a>). Requirements that were prioritized for
    implementation in the early iterations (via the <a class="elementLink" href="./../../openup/workproducts/work_items_list_39D03CC8.html" guid="_rGNWsCbSEdqh1LYUOGRh2A">Work Items List</a>) are then
    described in sufficient detail to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Validate the development team''s understanding of the requirements
    </li>
    <li>
        Ensure concurrence with stakeholders
    </li>
    <li>
        Permit software development to begin
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    (See <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../openup/tasks/detail_requirements_9747F71E.html" guid="_0e1mIMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">Task: Detail Requirements</a>). For each of these requirements, define associated test
    cases to ensure that the requirements are verifiable, and to provide the guidance needed for verification and
    validation (see <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../openup/tasks/create_test_cases_D39E98A1.html" guid="_0iwc0clgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">Task: Create Test Cases</a>).
</p>
<p>
    During Construction, the focus shifts to refining the system definition. This consists of detailing the remaining
    requirements and associated test cases as needed to drive implementation and verification, and managing requirements
    change (see activity <a class="elementLink" href="./../../openup/capabilitypatterns/ongoing_tasks_91569239.html" guid="_0pJ_xslgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">Ongoing tasks</a>).

    This activity takes place at the beginning of the first iteration, when the project starts. The goal of this activity
    is to establish the vision for both the project and the project plan at a high level of granularity.

    that map to the roles of human actors of the system that you are developing. Document the initial information on key&#xD;
    users and their environment in the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../openup/workproducts/vision_2E71B03C.html&quot; guid=&quot;_0WVxcMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw&quot;>Vision&lt;/a>.&#xD;

                <Description>Avoid rushing into defining the solution. First, gain agreement on the definition of the problem by asking the stakeholders&#xD;
what they see as the problem. Then search for root causes, or the “problem behind the problem.”&#xD;
Use&amp;nbsp;techniques&amp;nbsp;like the ones&amp;nbsp;described in&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;elementlinkwithtype&quot; href=&quot;./../../openup/guidances/guidelines/req_gathering_techniques_8CB8E44C.html&quot; guid=&quot;_OnoNQNSAEdmLhZ9H5Plxyw&quot;>Guideline: Requirements Gathering Techniques&lt;/a>. Formulate the problem statement, and then fill in the corresponding section from &lt;a class=&quot;elementlinkwithtype&quot; href=&quot;./../../openup/guidances/templates/vision_C2DEEF73.html&quot; guid=&quot;_0cW54MlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw&quot;>Template: Vision&lt;/a>.

Each one is applicable in a particular&#xD;
    situation or to a certain type of stakeholder.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If you can meet stakeholders in person, then you can conduct an interview or a brainstorming session. This face to face&#xD;
    collaboration is extremely valuable and reduces the chances of the project team misunderstanding the needs of the&#xD;
    stakeholders.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Some requirements may already be documented in an existing Work Item List. This can often be used as a solid starting&#xD;
    position from which a full set of requirements can be created.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Any requirements gathered during this step should be captured in the Work Item List.&#xD;

                <Description>Project planning, even at the summary level, should not be done in isolation since it outlines what the project will&#xD;

is covered.</Description>

    for discussing with the stakeholders priorities for what seems realistic to develop within the constraints of the&#xD;
    project.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If the project is feature-driven, the team looks at how many people they would need to complete these work items, which&#xD;
    gives them a high level understanding of project duration, staffing profile, and scope.&amp;nbsp;If the project instead is&#xD;
    date-driven, the team assesses how much work can roughly be done in the time-frame given and using the available team.&#xD;
    Out-of-scope work can be considered in future releases.&#xD;

                <Description>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The team identifies project risks, performs a qualitative risk analysis to assess their order of magnitude, and updates&#xD;
    the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot; href=&quot;./../../openup/workproducts/risk_list.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;_Ckay8Cc_EduIsqH1Q6ZuqA&quot;>Artifact: Risk List&lt;/a>. The project manager facilitates the team decision about which&#xD;
    risks they should respond to, and which risks they should watch for.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Responses may include avoiding or mitigating risks, exploring opportunities or increasing the probability and positive&#xD;
    impacts of the risk. Depending on the case, work items may have to be added or removed from the Work Items List to make&#xD;
    sure that responses will be prioritized and handled by the team along with project work. As it is not feasible to plan&#xD;
    responses for all risks identified, the team can decide to accept some of them. Risks to watch will be communicated to&#xD;
    stakeholders and remain on the Risk List and actions will be determined only if they occur.&#xD;
&lt;/p></Description>
              </Step>
              <Step name="Outline project lifecycle" briefDescription="" id="_sWzfgOeUEdusqr8cJFUf_w" orderingGuide="" presentationName="" suppressed="false" sectionName="" variabilityType="na">
                <Description>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Define the iteration length and use it to assess target velocity (see &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../openup/guidances/guidelines/agile_estimation.html&quot; guid=&quot;_CGHskBEdEdqY7JB6N6CW2w&quot;>Guideline: Agile&#xD;
    Estimation&lt;/a>). The number of items to be delivered in each iteration will be set by the velocity of the team and the&#xD;
    estimates for each item. The team uses the Work Items List to outline what features to implement in what iteration,&#xD;
    putting top priority work items first, including planned responses to the higher risks or opportunities.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    OpenUP organizes iterations into a set of phases. Each phase in the project lifecycle will end with a milestone aimed&#xD;
    at providing stakeholders with&amp;nbsp;oversight and steering mechanisms to control project funding, scope, risk exposure,&#xD;
    value provided, and other aspects of the process (see &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../openup/guidances/concepts/project_lifecycle.html&quot; guid=&quot;_nSfVwCNYEdyCq8v2ZO4QcA&quot;>Concept: Project&#xD;
    Lifecycle&lt;/a>)&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    You don''t need to spend too much time in doing this planning. The Project plan should document only&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;a brief&#xD;
    summary of&amp;nbsp; project milestones&amp;nbsp;and 1-3 objectives for each iteration. Do not commit individual work items to&#xD;
    the plan, since this will force too much re-planning. The goal is just to create a high-level plan outlining&#xD;

              <MainDescription><![CDATA[<p>
    This activity is performed throughout the project lifecycle. The goal of this activity is to identify risks and issues
    early enough that they can be mitigated, to establish the goals for the iteration, and to support the development team
    in reaching these goals.
</p>
<p>
    The <a class="elementlinkwithusertext" href="./../../openup/roles/project_manager.html"
    guid="_0a0o0MlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">project manager</a> and the team launch the iteration. The prioritization of work for a
    given iteration takes place. The project manager, <a class="elementlinkwithusertext"
    href="./../../openup/roles/stakeholder.html" guid="_dTa6gMAYEdqX-s4mWhkyqQ">stakeholders</a>, and team members agree on
    what is supposed to be developed during that iteration.
</p>
<p>
    Team members sign up for the work items they will develop in that iteration. Each team member breaks down the work
    items into development tasks and estimates the effort. This provides a more accurate estimate of the amount of time
    that will be spent, and of what can be realistically achieved, in a given iteration.
</p>
<p>
    As the iteration runs, the team meets regularly to report status of work completed, the work to do next, and issues
    blocking the progress. In some projects, this status checking occurs in daily meetings, which allows for a more precise
    understanding of how the work in an iteration is progressing. As necessary, the team makes corrections to achieve what
    was planned. The overall idea is that risks and issues are identified and managed throughout the iteration, and
    everyone knows the project status in a timely manner.
</p>
<p>
    During iteration assessments, the key success criterion is the demonstration that planned functionality has been
    implemented. Lessons learned are captured in order to modify the project or improve the process. If the iteration end
    coincides with the phase end, make sure the objectives for that phase have been met (see <a class="elementLinkWithType"
    href="./../../openup/guidances/concepts/phase_milestones.html" guid="_HNxbwMBJEdqSgKaj2SZBmg">Concept: Phase
    Milestones</a> for more information).

    The project manager needs to do the following:&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        continuously monitor the project to ensure it is progressing appropriately&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        enable the team to react as soon as possible to any change&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Many alternative means may be used to track the status. Quick, daily meetings with the entire project team are useful&#xD;
    to understand what team members have accomplished since the&amp;nbsp;last meeting, and what they plan to accomplish before&#xD;
    the next meeting. It also allows the team to identify any blocking issues. See &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../openup/guidances/guidelines/daily_meetings.html&quot; guid=&quot;_251UMCmREdyy6Oss2-0s1g&quot;>Guideline: Daily&#xD;
    Meetings&lt;/a>.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Another approach is the collection of basic metrics, ideally automatically generated from the tools at hand, or&#xD;
    manually assembled. &lt;span&#xD;

    charts are one of the most useful project progress metrics. They show how many work items where accomplished during&#xD;
    previous iterations (or days) and the remaining work. They can be used to track project releases and iterations&#xD;
    (see&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot; href=&quot;./../../openup/guidances/reports/project_burndown.html&quot;&#xD;

    stakeholders and project team at all times.&lt;/span> The &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;

                <Description>&lt;p>&#xD;
    One of the project manager''s key responsibilities is to know about the project team''s problems and issues. The manager&#xD;
    needs to focus on problems that are blocking progress. A quick, daily meeting is usually a good way to monitor those&#xD;
    problems and issues.&amp;nbsp;A record of issues that have to be solved within the team may be kept in the &lt;a&#xD;
    class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../openup/workproducts/iteration_plan.html&quot; guid=&quot;_0aQBEslgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw&quot;>Iteration&#xD;
    Plan&lt;/a>&lt;font color=&quot;#003399&quot;>.&lt;/font>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Identify the cause and impact of problems and exceptions as they arise. Identify possible solutions for problems that&#xD;
    have an immediate impact on the short-term goals and objectives and identify who needs to be involved in implementing&#xD;
    the solution. Then, define the corrective actions and implement them.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p></Description>

The&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
    entire team should be involved in identifying and mitigating risks.&#xD;

              <Step name="Manage objectives" briefDescription="" id="_Br6VECuxEdqTIKp3l5PtzQ" orderingGuide="" presentationName="" suppressed="false" sectionName="" variabilityType="na">
                <Description>When a team is falling significantly behind, or critical problems occur, that prevents the team&amp;nbsp;from meeting the&#xD;
iteration objectives it may be necessary to descope work to ensure that the team delivers a useful product increment by the&#xD;
end of the iteration, while maximizing stakeholder value. The project manager should work with the team and&#xD;
stakeholders&amp;nbsp;to revise the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../openup/workproducts/iteration_plan_B46FED39.html&quot; guid=&quot;_0aQBEslgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw&quot;>Iteration Plan&lt;/a> and, as necessary, reduce the emphasis on less critical tasks postponing&#xD;
them to a subsequent iteration. In rare cases, if the iteration objectives still seem impossible to be met, the team might&#xD;
consider terminating the iteration or reformulating the iteration to a new objective.</Description>

    This activity describes the tasks you perform to gather, specify, analyze, and validate a subset of
    system''s requirements prior to implementation and verification. This does not imply that all
    requirements are detailed prior to commencing implementation. Rather, you perform this activity throughout the
    lifecycle with <a class="elementLink" href="./../../openup/roles/stakeholder_9FFD4106.html" guid="_dTa6gMAYEdqX-s4mWhkyqQ">Stakeholder</a>s and the entire development team collaborating to ensure that a clear,
    consistent, correct, verifiable, and feasible set of requirements is available, as needed, to drive
    implementation and verification.
</p>
<p>
    During <b>Inception</b>, the focus is on gaining agreement on the problem to be solved, gathering stakeholder needs,
    and capturing high-level system features (see activity <a class="elementLink" href="./../../openup/capabilitypatterns/initiate_project_D9C03857.html" guid="_0pWNA8lgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">Initiate project</a>).
</p>
<p>
    During <b>Elaboration</b>, the focus shifts to defining the solution. This consists of finding those requirements that
    have the most value to stakeholders, that are particularly challenging or risky, or that are architecturally significant
    (See <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../openup/tasks/find_and_outline_requirements_90D272B9.html" guid="_P9cMUPV_EdmdHa9MmVPgqQ">Task: Find and Outline Requirements</a>). You then describe requirements (that
    are prioritized, via the <a class="elementLink" href="./../../openup/workproducts/work_items_list_39D03CC8.html" guid="_rGNWsCbSEdqh1LYUOGRh2A">Work Items List</a>, for implementation in the early iterations) 
    in sufficient detail to validate the development team''s understanding of the requirements, to ensure concurrence with
    stakeholders, and to permit software development to begin (see <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../openup/tasks/detail_requirements_9747F71E.html" guid="_0e1mIMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">Task: Detail Requirements</a>). For each of these requirements, define associated test cases to ensure that the
    requirements are verifiable, and to provide the guidance needed for verification and validation (see <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../openup/tasks/create_test_cases_D39E98A1.html" guid="_0iwc0clgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">Task: Create Test Cases</a>).
</p>
<p>
    During Construction, the focus shifts to refining the system definition. This consists of detailing the
    remaining requirements and associated test cases as necessary to drive implementation and verification, and managing
    requirements change (see activity <a class="elementLink" href="./../../openup/capabilitypatterns/ongoing_tasks_91569239.html" guid="_0pJ_xslgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">Ongoing tasks</a>).

    Use various techniques to make gathering requirements easier. Face-to-face meetings with stakeholders is the most&#xD;
    effective way to understand stakeholder needs and to gather and validate requirements, but you must prepare in order&#xD;
    for these meetings to run efficiently.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Be prepared by gathering and reviewing information related to the problem domain, problem statement, business&#xD;
    environment and key stakeholders. Most of this information should be available in the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot; href=&quot;./../../openup/workproducts/vision_2E71B03C.html&quot; guid=&quot;_0WVxcMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw&quot;>Artifact: Vision&lt;/a>.&amp;nbsp; Review the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot; href=&quot;./../../openup/workproducts/work_items_list_39D03CC8.html&quot; guid=&quot;_rGNWsCbSEdqh1LYUOGRh2A&quot;>Artifact: Work Items List&lt;/a> for stakeholder requests.&#xD;

    Requirements can be broadly classified as either functional or non-functional requirements. The former specify what the&#xD;
    system must do. The latter specify constraints on the solution such as usability, reliability, performance,&#xD;
    supportability, interfaces with legacy systems, etc. Depending upon the domain there may be regulatory requirements&#xD;
    that apply.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Collaborate with stakeholders to identify the types of requirements relevant to your system. This will help you assess&#xD;

              <MainDescription><![CDATA[<p>
    This activity refines the initial high-level architecture into working software. The objective is to produce
    stable software that adequately addresses the technical risks in scope.
</p>
<p>
    The architect and developers work together to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Refine the initial sketch of the architecture into concrete design elements
    </li>
    <li>
        Ensure that the architecture decisions are adequately captured and communicated
    </li>
    <li>
        Ensure that the team has enough information to enable software to be developed
    </li>
    <li>
        Ensure that the requirements that were prioritized for the current iteration are adequately addressed in the software
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    In an iterative project, the team should not attempt to develop the architecture for the entire project in a
    single pass. Rather, they should focus on meeting the requirements in scope for the current iteration, while making
    decisions in the context of the wider project.

    Identify the key abstractions that the system needs to handle. These can usually be found&amp;nbsp;by looking for nouns&#xD;
    that the requirements emphasize or repeat, because they help identify what is important to the business. The &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../openup/workproducts/glossary_5D300778.html&quot; guid=&quot;_Wn7HcNcEEdqz_d2XWoVt6Q&quot;>Glossary&lt;/a>&#xD;
    is also a useful source for key abstractions as it is itself a list of business nouns. Not all nouns will be key&#xD;
    abstractions in the system though, so work with the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../openup/roles/analyst_39D7C49B.html&quot; guid=&quot;_0VxJsMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw&quot;>Analyst&lt;/a> and &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../openup/roles/stakeholder_9FFD4106.html&quot; guid=&quot;_dTa6gMAYEdqX-s4mWhkyqQ&quot;>Stakeholder&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;as they will&#xD;

              <MainDescription><![CDATA[<p>
    The goal of this activity is to define a technical approach to the system that supports the project
    requirements, within the constraints placed on the system and the development team. The architect should do the
    following: 
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Work with the team to create an initial sketch of the technical approach to the proposed system
    </li>
    <li>
        Ensure that the technical decisions are adequately captured and communicated
    </li>
    <li>
        Ensure that the team has enough information to understand the approach that your are taking
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The work done here does not seek to produce a detailed and comprehensive technical specification for the system.
    Rather, the approach should be to decide the overall technical approach at a high level.
</p>
<p>
    You should focus on proving the architecture with working software. If the solution is similar to a previously
    produced solution (or is a well-known solution domain), then it will probably be good enough to
    reference that example as evidence of the feasibility of the approach. In some cases, it may be necessary to develop
    one or more prototypes to validate some of the decisions or clarify some of the requirements.
</p>
<p>
    The conclusion of this work should produce just enough information to communicate the architecture to the team, and
    to demonstrate its viability to the customer. This allows the project to move forward, enabling you to
    refine and baseline the architecture.

    Introduction
</h1>
<p>
    Run this activity as a way to perform goal-based planning and execution. Work is taken on by developers, and work
    progress is tracked based on the goals achieved using the designed, developer-tested, and integrated source code.
</p>
<h2>
    Context of what is being developed
</h2>
<p>
    A context can be specified when a requirement is assigned to be developed, thus specifying how broadly a requirement is
    to be developed in an iteration. Development may focus on a layer (such as the user interface, business logic, or
    database access), on a component, and so on.
</p>
<p>
    Whether a context is specified or not, the developer''s responsibility is to create a design and implementation for that
    requirement.&nbsp;The developer&nbsp;also writes and runs developer tests against the implementation to make sure that
    it works as designed, both as a unit and integrated into the code base.
</p>
<h2>
    Overview of workflow
</h2>
<p>
    Typical changes require some effort in designing the solution before moving into implementation, even if it is only a
    mental exercise that results in no long-term work product. The design for trivial changes to the existing
    implementation (to, for example, support some requirement) might be self-evident in the context of the existing
    architecture and design.
</p>
<p>
    Once the organization of the technical solution is clear, define developer tests that will verify the implementation.
    This test-driven approach ensures that design considerations have in fact taken place before the solution is coded. The
    tests are run up front and, if they fail, clearly define the criteria to determine if the implementation works as
    intended.
</p>
<p>
    Failed tests lead to&nbsp;an implementation of the solution, upon completion of which you run the tests again. This
    innermost loop of implementation and developer testing is repeated until the tests pass.
</p>
<p>
    Passing the tests does not necessarily mean that the solution is a high-quality, appropriate solution. It is proper to
    revisit the design at this point. That path loops back through the process, since any changes to the design could
    affect the developer tests and implementation.
</p>
<p>
    Once the tests pass and the design of the solution is appropriate, there is one more possible loopback. It is best to
    keep the test-driven, evolutionary design inner loops as tight as possible. Come up with some small-scale design
    solution for a part of the work item, define a test or two for the implementation of that one part of the solution,
    pass that test, verify the quality, and then continue on in a test-first manner until that part of the design is
    working. Then, in the outermost loop of the activity, go back to the work item and design another chunk to get closer
    to completion.

              <UsageNotes><![CDATA[<p>
    This activity occurs multiple times during each iteration. Usually, there is one instance for each work item planned
    for that iteration. When instantiated in a project plan, the pattern becomes a development task to be taken on by one
    or more developers, and you should rename it to include the actual requirement name. Optionally, the words <b>Solution
    Increment</b>&nbsp;may be suppressed, then you can instantiate the pattern this way:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p align="left">
        Develop requirement_name (within context_name context)
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
    If a context is specified, there will be one instance of this pattern for each requirement for each context.
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        <b>Example</b>
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Develop scenario 1 (within user interface context)
        </li>
        <li>
            Develop scenario 1 (within business logic and database access context)
        </li>
        <li>
            Develop scenario 2
        </li>
        <li>
            Develop supplemental requirement 1
        </li>
    </ol>
</blockquote>
<p>
    Note that there are four instances of this pattern in the preceding example:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The first two are related to the same requirement (scenario 1) but within two different contexts
    </li>
    <li>
        The last two are related to different requirements, with no context specified.
    </li>
</ul>]]></UsageNotes>

    If the requirements are not represented in some sort of scenario form (for example a non-functional requirement might&#xD;

                <Description>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Identify the elements that collaborate together to provide the required behavior. This can start with the key&#xD;
    abstractions identified in the Architecture Notebook, design, domain analysis, and classical analysis of the&#xD;
    requirements (noun filtering) to derive the elements that would be required to fulfill them. The &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../openup/guidances/guidelines/entity_control_boundary_pattern_C4047897.html&quot; guid=&quot;_uF-QYEAhEdq_UJTvM1DM2Q&quot;>Entity-Control-Boundary Pattern&lt;/a> provides a good start for identifying elements. Also&#xD;
    see &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot; href=&quot;./../../openup/guidances/guidelines/analyze_the_design_4C4750C0.html&quot; guid=&quot;__MnggPTdEduDKIuqTXQ8SA&quot;>Guideline: Analyze the Design&lt;/a>.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Existing elements of the design should be examined to see if they should participate in the collaboration. It is a&#xD;
    mistake to create all new elements in each execution of this task.&#xD;
&lt;/p></Description>

              <Step name="Determine how elements collaborate to realize the scenario" briefDescription="" id="_A_LU8KuLEdmhFZtkg1nakg" orderingGuide="" presentationName="" suppressed="false" sectionName="" variabilityType="na">
                <Description>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Walk through the scenario distributing responsibilities to the participating elements and ensuring that the elements&#xD;
    have the relationships required to collaborate.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    These responsibilities can be simple statements of behavior assigned to elements; they need not be detailed operation&#xD;
    specifications with parameters, etc. Similarly, the relationships can just be defined at this step. This step is about&#xD;
    ensuring that a quality model is being created that is robust enough to support the requirements. See &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot; href=&quot;./../../openup/guidances/guidelines/analyze_the_design_4C4750C0.html&quot; guid=&quot;__MnggPTdEduDKIuqTXQ8SA&quot;>Guideline: Analyze the Design&lt;/a>.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Look to the Architecture Notebook and previous design work to create a consistent collaboration. Work with the&#xD;
    architect to understand the details and motivations of the architecture. Look to reuse existing behavior and relations&#xD;
    or to apply similar structure to simplify the design of the overall system.&#xD;
&lt;/p></Description>

&#xD;
&#xD;
    Refine the design to an appropriate level of detail to drive implementation and to ensure that it fits into the&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
    architecture. In this step the design can take into consideration the actual implementation language and other&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
    technical decisions. Revisit the identification of the elements and the collaborations that realize the scenarios if&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
    necessary as this refinement takes into consideration details at a lower level of abstraction. Discuss testability&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
    issues, such as design elements that are difficult to test or critical performance areas, with the tester and&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
    architect.&#xD;

    Evolve the design by examining recent changes in the larger context of the design and determine if refactoring and&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
    redesigning techniques will improve the robustness, flexibility, and understandability of the design.

    Communicate&amp;nbsp;the system''s design to&amp;nbsp;those who need to understand it. Though this is described here toward the&#xD;
    end of the task, communication should be going on throughout the steps. Working collaboratively is always better than&#xD;
    reviewing the work after it is complete.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Here are some ways to communicate&amp;nbsp;the design:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Formal models&amp;nbsp;specified in UML.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Informal diagrams that render static structure and capture&amp;nbsp;dynamic behavior.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Annotated code that communicates information about the static structure. This can be&amp;nbsp;supplemented with textual&#xD;
        descriptions of collaborative behavior across code modules.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Data models to describe the database schema.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Here are some examples of individuals&amp;nbsp;who will need to understand the design of the system:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Developers&amp;nbsp;who will implement a solution based on the design.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Architects who can review the design to ensure that it conforms to the architecture or who might examine the design&#xD;
        for opportunities to improve the architecture.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Other designers who can examine the design for applicability to other parts of the system.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Developers or other designers who will be working on other parts of the system that will&amp;nbsp;depend on the&#xD;
        elements designed in this task.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Other reviewers&amp;nbsp;who will review the design for quality and adherence to standards.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></Description>

&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
    Consider the design from various angles to ensure that it is a high-quality, communicable design. Work with other&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
    technical team members; an independent party can provide a fresh perspective. Use the tester and architect to provide&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
    perspectives on design quality and adherence to the architecture. However, when identifying potential reviewers keep in&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
    mind that if someone can add value by reviewing the design, then perhaps they could have added even more value by&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
    actively participating in the design effort itself. If design flaws are identified, improve the design.&#xD;

    If you are using sophisticated modeling tools, you should be able to generate a portion of the required source code&#xD;
    from the model. Note that programming is&amp;nbsp;commonly required to complete the implementation after the design model&#xD;
    has been transformed into code.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Even without tools, there is&amp;nbsp;typically some amount of code that can be created by rote by examining the design and&#xD;

                <Description>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Write the source code to make the implementation conform to the design and expected behavior. You should strive to&#xD;
    reuse and/or generate code wherever possible, but you will still need to do some programming. To do so, consider the&#xD;
    following:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Examine the&amp;nbsp;requirements. Because some requirements information does not translate directly into your design&#xD;
        you should examine the requirement(s) to ensure that they are fully realized in the implementation.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Refactor your code to improve its design. &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
        href=&quot;./../../openup/guidances/concepts/refactoring.html&quot; guid=&quot;_Poc7IPDzEdqYgerqi84oCA&quot;>Refactoring&lt;/a> is a&#xD;
        technique where you improve the quality of your code via small, safe changes.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Tune the results of the existing implementation by improving performance, the user interface, security, and other&#xD;
        nonfunctional areas.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Add missing details, such as completing the logic of operations or adding supporting classes and data structures&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Handle boundary conditions.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Deal with unusual circumstances or error states.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Restrict behavior (preventing users or client code from executing illegal flows, scenarios, or combinations of&#xD;
        options).&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Add critical sections for multi-threaded or re-entrant code.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Though many different considerations are listed here, there is one clear way to know when the source code is done. The&#xD;
    solution has been implemented when it passes the developer tests. Any other considerations can be taken care of in a&#xD;
    refactoring pass over the code to improve it once it is complete and correct.&#xD;
&lt;/p></Description>
              </Step>
              <Step name="Evaluate the Implementation" briefDescription="" id="_ni25UKuPEdmhFZtkg1nakg" orderingGuide="" presentationName="" suppressed="false" sectionName="" variabilityType="na">
                <Description>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Verify that the implementation is fit for its purpose. Examine the code for its suitability to perform its intended&#xD;
    function. This is a quality assurance step that you perform in addition to testing which is described in other tasks.&#xD;
    Consider these strategies:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Pair programming. By pairing to implement the code in the first place, you effectively evaluate the code as its&#xD;
        being written.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Read through the code for common mistakes. Consider keeping a checklist of common mistakes that you make, as a&#xD;
        reminder reference.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Use tools to check for implementation errors and inappropriate code. For example, use a static code rule checker or&#xD;
        set the compiler to the most detailed warning level.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Use tools that can visualize the code. Code visualization, such as the UML visualizations in the Eclipse IDE, help&#xD;
        developers identify issues such as excessive coupling or circular dependencies.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Perform informal, targeted code inspections. Ask colleagues to review small critical sections of code and code with&#xD;
        significant churn. Avoid reviewing large sections of code.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Use&amp;nbsp;a tester to ensure the implementation is testable and understandable to testing resources.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Improve the implementation based on the results of these evaluations.&#xD;
&lt;/p></Description>

              <Step name="Communicate significant decisions" briefDescription="" id="_q5XiIKuPEdmhFZtkg1nakg" orderingGuide="" presentationName="" suppressed="false" sectionName="" variabilityType="na">
                <Description>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Communicate the impact of unexpected changes to the design and requirements.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The issues and constraints that you uncover when you implement the system must be communicated to the team. The impact&#xD;
    of issues discovered during implementation must be incorporated into future decisions. If appropriate, update&#xD;
    requirements to reflect ambiguities that you identified and resolved in the implementation so they can be tested and&#xD;
    you can manage the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../openup/roles/stakeholder.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;_dTa6gMAYEdqX-s4mWhkyqQ&quot;>Stakeholder&lt;/a> expectations appropriately. Similarly, update the design to reflect new&#xD;
    constraints and issues uncovered during implementation to be sure that the new information is communicated to other&#xD;
    developers.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Usually, there is no need for a change request if the required change is small and the same person is designing and&#xD;
    implementing the code element. That individual can make the design change directly. If the required change has a broad&#xD;
    impact, it may be necessary to communicate that change to the other team members through a change request.&#xD;

    automated and whether additional test components are necessary,&amp;nbsp;such as&amp;nbsp;drivers or stubs.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    To run the tests, you need to make sure that you have initialized the test environment with all necessary elements,&#xD;
    such as software, hardware, tools, data, and so on.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Automated tests will often update a &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../openup/workproducts/test_log_CBA2FDF4.html&quot; guid=&quot;_0ZlSsMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw&quot;>Test Log&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;which you can evaluate to determine where your tests went wrong.&#xD;

                <Description>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Evaluate the test execution by analyzing the test run.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Testing will&amp;nbsp;complete either&amp;nbsp;normally or abnormally.&amp;nbsp; For correctly implemented tests, a normal&#xD;
    completion represents a passed test, though it could warrant additional examination of the test log to ensure&amp;nbsp;the&#xD;
    test&amp;nbsp;ran as expected.&amp;nbsp; Abnormal termination could be premature termination or just a test that does not&#xD;
    complete as intended.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Review the test log to understand any reported failures, warnings, or unexpected results. The cause of the problem(s)&#xD;
    might be that the implementation element being tested is faulty, a problem with the developer tests, or a problem with&#xD;
    the environment.&#xD;
&lt;/p></Description>
              </Step>
              <Step name="Respond to test results" briefDescription="" id="_SXPFkMP4EdmWKcx6ixEiwg" orderingGuide="" presentationName="" suppressed="false" sectionName="" variabilityType="na">
                <Description>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Determine the appropriate corrective action to recover from a &quot;failed&quot; developer test run. If the implementation&#xD;
    element under test is faulty, fix the problem if possible and rerun the tests. If the problem is serious and cannot be&#xD;
    immediately addressed, perform the task &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../openup/tasks/request_change_A048C387.html&quot; guid=&quot;_0mwzEclgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw&quot;>Request Change&lt;/a> to report the defect. If the developer test is faulty fix the test and rerun the tests. If there was a&#xD;
    problem with the environment, resolve it and then rerun&amp;nbsp;the tests.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    When the developer tests pass, communicate the results. If the passing of these tests represent completion of a&#xD;
    requirement, this could involve updating the status of something on the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../openup/workproducts/work_items_list_39D03CC8.html&quot; guid=&quot;_rGNWsCbSEdqh1LYUOGRh2A&quot;>Work Items List&lt;/a>.&#xD;

    This activity is repeated throughout the project lifecycle. The main goal of this activity is to validate that the

    current build of the system satisfies the requirements allocated to it.

</p>

<p>

    Throughout the iterations, your intent is to validate that the implemented requirements reflect a robust

    architecture, and that the remaining requirements are consistently implemented on top of that architecture. As

    developers implement the solution for the requirements in a given iteration, unit test the integrated source code.

    Then, a <a class="elementlinkwithusertext" href="./../../openup/roles/tester_9859B590.html" guid="_0ZM4MclgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">tester</a> conducts system-level testing in parallel with development to make sure that

    the solution, which is continuously being integrated, satisfies the intent specified in the test cases. The tester

    defines what techniques to use, what the data input is, and what <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../openup/guidances/guidelines/test_suite_D54EEBED.html" guid="_0aDz0MlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">test suites</a> to

    create. As tests run, defects are identified and added to the <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../openup/workproducts/work_items_list_39D03CC8.html" guid="_rGNWsCbSEdqh1LYUOGRh2A">work items list</a>, so

    that they can be prioritized as part of the work that you will do during iterations.

automated. If the Test Case is well understood, it''s best to implement an automated Test Script without first writing a&#xD;
manual procedure. However, if the Test Case is new or novel, writing a manual Test Script can help validate the design of&#xD;
the test and aid collaboration with other team members.

    Develop a detailed, procedural Test Script based on your design. Use a request-response style that declares an exact&#xD;
    input, and expects an exact output.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Explain the pre-conditions that must be met before running this Test Script. Use temporary test data or put parameters&#xD;
    in your script for data values. Ensure that each post-condition in the Test Case is evaluated by steps in the Test&#xD;
    Script.&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If the Test Script uses a dataset (such as a file or database), add the new test data to it and parameterize the Test&#xD;
    Script to retrieve values from the dataset. Otherwise, add executable test data values to the steps of the Test Script.&#xD;
    This applies to both manual and automated scripts.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Identify and minimize dependencies between test data used or modified by other Test Scripts. Note dependencies in the&#xD;
    Test Script.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

    Post the test results in a conspicuous place that is accessible to the entire team, such as a white board or wiki.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For each failing test script, analyze the Test Log to identify the cause of the test failure. Begin with failing tests&#xD;
    that you expected to begin passing against this build, which may indicate newly delivered work items that do not meet&#xD;
    the conditions of satisfaction. Then review previously passing test scripts that are now failing, which may indicate&#xD;
    regressive issues in the build.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        If a test failed because the solution does not meet the conditions of satisfaction for the test case, log the issue&#xD;
        in the Work Items List. In the work item, clearly identify the observed behavior, the expected behavior, and steps&#xD;
        to repeat the issue. Note which failing test initially discovered the issue.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        If a test failed because of a change in the system (such as a user-interface change), but the implementation still&#xD;
        meets the conditions of satisfaction in the test case, update the test script to pass with the new implementation.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        If a test failed because the test script is incorrect (a false negative result) or passed when it was expected to&#xD;
        fail (a false positive result), update the test script to correctly implement the conditions of satisfaction in the&#xD;
        test case. If the test case for a requirement is invalid, perform the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot; href=&quot;./../../openup/tasks/request_change_A048C387.html&quot; guid=&quot;_0mwzEclgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw&quot;>Task: Request Change&lt;/a> to&#xD;

If the change to the test script is trivial, update the test while analyzing the test results. If the&#xD;

              <MainDescription><![CDATA[<h3>
    Introduction
</h3>
<p>
    Run this activity as a way to perform a goal-based planning and execution. Work is taken on by developers and work
    progress is tracked based on the goals achieved using the designed, developer-tested, and integrated source code.
</p>
<h4>
    Context of what is being developed
</h4>
<p>
    A context can be specified when a requirement is assigned to be developed, thus specifying how broadly a requirement is
    to be developed in a iteration. Development may focus on a layer (such as the user interface, business logic, or
    database access), on a component, and so on.
</p>
<p>
    Whether a context is specified or not, the developer''s responsibility is to create a design and implementation for that
    requirement.&nbsp;The developer&nbsp;also writes and runs developer tests against the implementation to make sure that
    it works as designed, both as a unit and integrated into the code base.
</p>
<h4>
    Overview of workflow
</h4>
<p>
    Typical changes require some effort in designing the solution before moving into implementation, even if it is only a
    mental exercise that results in no long-term work product. The design for trivial changes to the existing
    implementation (to, for example, support some requirement) might be self-evident in the context of the existing
    architecture and design.
</p>
<p>
    Once the organization of the technical solution is clear, the development and testing of the implementation ensues.
    This development and testing can be done as a tight, innermost loop of the activity until the developer tests pass.
</p>
<p>
    Passing the tests does not necessarily mean that the solution is a high-quality, appropriate solution. It is proper to
    revisit the design at this point. That path loops back through the process, since any changes to the design could
    affect the developer tests and implementation.
</p>
<p>
    Once the tests pass and the design of the solution is appropriate, there is one more possible loopback. It is best to
    keep the&nbsp;implementation and&nbsp;evolutionary design inner loops as tight as possible. Come up with some
    small-scale design solution for a part of the work item, implement and test&nbsp;that one part of the solution, verify
    the quality, and then continue on until that part of the design is working. Then, in the outermost loop of the
    activity, go back to the work item and design another chunk to get closer to completion.
</p>]]></MainDescription>
              <KeyConsiderations></KeyConsiderations>
              <Alternatives><![CDATA[This pattern allows for tests to be created before the implementation, while implementation is carrying on, or after code
has been implemented; some organizations might want to apply a pattern that is more prescriptively test-first or
test-after.&nbsp; Additionally, it is healthy to revisit the design after some working code has been written; this idea is
not explicitly captured in this pattern.]]></Alternatives>

    <li>
        For developers: To create a solution for the work item for which they are responsible
    </li>
    <li>
        For project managers: To have a goal-based way of tracking project status
    </li>

              <UsageNotes><![CDATA[<p>
    This activity occurs multiple times during each iteration. Usually, there is one instance for each work item planned
    for that iteration. When instantiated in a project plan, the pattern becomes a development task to be taken on by one
    or more developers, and it should be renamed to include the actual requirement name. Optionally, the words
    <strong>Solution Increment</strong> may be suppressed, then you can instantiate the pattern this way:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p align="left">
        Develop requirement_name (within context_name context)
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
    If a context is specified, there will be one instance of this pattern for each requirement for each context.
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        <strong>Example</strong>
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Develop scenario 1 (within user interface context)
        </li>
        <li>
            Develop scenario 1 (within business logic and DB access context)
        </li>
        <li>
            Develop scenario 2
        </li>
        <li>
            Develop supplemental requirement 1
        </li>
    </ol>
</blockquote>
<p>
    Note that there are four instances of this pattern in the preceding example:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The first two are related to the same requirement (scenario 1) but within two different contexts
    </li>
    <li>
        The last two are related to different requirements, with no context specified.
    </li>
</ul>]]></UsageNotes>

    If the requirements are not represented in some sort of scenario form (for example a non-functional requirement might&#xD;

                <Description>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Identify the elements that collaborate together to provide the required behavior. This can start with the key&#xD;
    abstractions identified in the Architecture Notebook, design, domain analysis, and classical analysis of the&#xD;
    requirements (noun filtering) to derive the elements that would be required to fulfill them. The &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../openup/guidances/guidelines/entity_control_boundary_pattern_C4047897.html&quot; guid=&quot;_uF-QYEAhEdq_UJTvM1DM2Q&quot;>Entity-Control-Boundary Pattern&lt;/a> provides a good start for identifying elements.

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Existing elements of the design should be examined to see if they should participate in the collaboration. It is a&#xD;
    mistake to create all new elements in each execution of this task.&#xD;

              <Step name="Determine how elements collaborate to realize the scenario" briefDescription="" id="_A_LU8KuLEdmhFZtkg1nakg" orderingGuide="" presentationName="" suppressed="false" sectionName="" variabilityType="na">
                <Description>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Walk through the scenario distributing responsibilities to the participating elements and ensuring that the elements&#xD;
    have the relationships required to collaborate.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    These responsibilities can be simple statements of behavior assigned to elements; they need not be detailed operation&#xD;
    specifications with parameters, etc. Similarly, the relationships can just be defined at this step. This step is about&#xD;
    ensuring that a quality model is being created that is robust enough to support the requirements. See &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot; href=&quot;./../../openup/guidances/guidelines/analyze_the_design_4C4750C0.html&quot; guid=&quot;__MnggPTdEduDKIuqTXQ8SA&quot;>Guideline: Analyze the Design&lt;/a>.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Look to the Architecture Notebook and previous design work to create a consistent collaboration. Work with the&#xD;
    architect to understand the details and motivations of the architecture. Look to reuse existing behavior and relations&#xD;
    or to apply similar structure to simplify the design of the overall system.&#xD;

    Refine the design to an appropriate level of detail to drive implementation and to ensure that it fits into the&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
    architecture. In this step the design can take into consideration the actual implementation language and other&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
    technical decisions. Revisit the identification of the elements and the collaborations that realize the scenarios if&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
    necessary as this refinement takes into consideration details at a lower level of abstraction. Discuss testability&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
    issues, such as design elements that are difficult to test or critical performance areas, with the tester and&#xD;

&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Developers&amp;nbsp;who will implement a solution based on the design.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Architects who can review the design to ensure that it conforms to the architecture or who might examine the design&#xD;
        for opportunities to improve the architecture.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Other designers who can examine the design for applicability to other parts of the system.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Developers or other designers who will be working on other parts of the system that will&amp;nbsp;depend on the&#xD;
        elements designed in this task.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Other reviewers&amp;nbsp;who will review the design for quality and adherence to standards.&#xD;

    Consider the design from various angles to ensure that it is a high-quality, communicable design. Work with other&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
    technical team members; an independent party can provide a fresh perspective. Use the tester and architect to provide&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
    perspectives on design quality and adherence to the architecture. However, when identifying potential reviewers keep in&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
    mind that if someone can add value by reviewing the design, then perhaps they could have added even more value by&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
    actively participating in the design effort itself. If design flaws are identified, improve the design.&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Even without tools, there is&amp;nbsp;typically some amount of code that can be created by rote by examining the design and&#xD;

                <Description>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Write the source code to make the implementation conform to the design and expected behavior. You should strive to&#xD;
    reuse and/or generate code wherever possible, but you will still need to do some programming. To do so, consider the&#xD;
    following:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Examine the&amp;nbsp;requirements. Because some requirements information does not translate directly into your design&#xD;
        you should examine the requirement(s) to ensure that they are fully realized in the implementation.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Refactor your code to improve its design. &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
        href=&quot;./../../openup/guidances/concepts/refactoring.html&quot; guid=&quot;_Poc7IPDzEdqYgerqi84oCA&quot;>Refactoring&lt;/a> is a&#xD;
        technique where you improve the quality of your code via small, safe changes.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Tune the results of the existing implementation by improving performance, the user interface, security, and other&#xD;
        nonfunctional areas.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Add missing details, such as completing the logic of operations or adding supporting classes and data structures&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Handle boundary conditions.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Deal with unusual circumstances or error states.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Restrict behavior (preventing users or client code from executing illegal flows, scenarios, or combinations of&#xD;
        options).&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Add critical sections for multi-threaded or re-entrant code.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Though many different considerations are listed here, there is one clear way to know when the source code is done. The&#xD;
    solution has been implemented when it passes the developer tests. Any other considerations can be taken care of in a&#xD;
    refactoring pass over the code to improve it once it is complete and correct.&#xD;
&lt;/p></Description>

              <Step name="Evaluate the Implementation" briefDescription="" id="_ni25UKuPEdmhFZtkg1nakg" orderingGuide="" presentationName="" suppressed="false" sectionName="" variabilityType="na">
                <Description>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Verify that the implementation is fit for its purpose. Examine the code for its suitability to perform its intended&#xD;
    function. This is a quality assurance step that you perform in addition to testing which is described in other tasks.&#xD;
    Consider these strategies:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Pair programming. By pairing to implement the code in the first place, you effectively evaluate the code as its&#xD;
        being written.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Read through the code for common mistakes. Consider keeping a checklist of common mistakes that you make, as a&#xD;
        reminder reference.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Use tools to check for implementation errors and inappropriate code. For example, use a static code rule checker or&#xD;
        set the compiler to the most detailed warning level.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Use tools that can visualize the code. Code visualization, such as the UML visualizations in the Eclipse IDE, help&#xD;
        developers identify issues such as excessive coupling or circular dependencies.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Perform informal, targeted code inspections. Ask colleagues to review small critical sections of code and code with&#xD;
        significant churn. Avoid reviewing large sections of code.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Use&amp;nbsp;a tester to ensure the implementation is testable and understandable to testing resources.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Improve the implementation based on the results of these evaluations.&#xD;
&lt;/p></Description>

              <Step name="Communicate significant decisions" briefDescription="" id="_q5XiIKuPEdmhFZtkg1nakg" orderingGuide="" presentationName="" suppressed="false" sectionName="" variabilityType="na">
                <Description>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Communicate the impact of unexpected changes to the design and requirements.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The issues and constraints that you uncover when you implement the system must be communicated to the team. The impact&#xD;
    of issues discovered during implementation must be incorporated into future decisions. If appropriate, update&#xD;
    requirements to reflect ambiguities that you identified and resolved in the implementation so they can be tested and&#xD;
    you can manage the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../openup/roles/stakeholder.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;_dTa6gMAYEdqX-s4mWhkyqQ&quot;>Stakeholder&lt;/a> expectations appropriately. Similarly, update the design to reflect new&#xD;
    constraints and issues uncovered during implementation to be sure that the new information is communicated to other&#xD;
    developers.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Usually, there is no need for a change request if the required change is small and the same person is designing and&#xD;
    implementing the code element. That individual can make the design change directly. If the required change has a broad&#xD;
    impact, it may be necessary to communicate that change to the other team members through a change request.&#xD;

    Determine the appropriate corrective action to recover from a &quot;failed&quot; developer test run. If the implementation&#xD;
    element under test is faulty, fix the problem if possible and rerun the tests. If the problem is serious and cannot be&#xD;
    immediately addressed, perform the task &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../openup/tasks/request_change_A048C387.html&quot; guid=&quot;_0mwzEclgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw&quot;>Request Change&lt;/a> to report the defect. If the developer test is faulty fix the test and rerun the tests. If there was a&#xD;
    problem with the environment, resolve it and then rerun&amp;nbsp;the tests.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    When the developer tests pass, communicate the results. If the passing of these tests represent completion of a&#xD;
    requirement, this could involve updating the status of something on the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../openup/workproducts/work_items_list_39D03CC8.html&quot; guid=&quot;_rGNWsCbSEdqh1LYUOGRh2A&quot;>Work Items List&lt;/a>.&#xD;

    OpenUP is an iterative process with <a class="elementlinkwithusertext"
    href="./../../openup/guidances/concepts/core_principle_evolve.html" guid="_GXiogMvoEdqukPpotm3DYg">iterations</a>
    distributed throughout four <a class="elementLinkWithUserText"
    href="./../../base_concepts/guidances/concepts/phase.html" guid="__7xOEC7aEdqHMdmRzC0-2g">phases</a>: <a
    class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../openup/guidances/concepts/inception_phase.html"
    guid="_0hmKgBOMEduCNqgZdt_OaA">Inception</a>, <a class="elementLinkWithUserText"

    href="./../../openup/guidances/concepts/transition_phase.html" guid="__ca5UBOMEduCNqgZdt_OaA">Transition</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Each phase may have as many iterations as needed (depending on the degree of novelty of the business domain, the
    technology being used, architectural complexity, and project size, to name a few factors).
</p>
<p>
    To offer a quick start for teams to plan their iterations, OpenUP provides work breakdown structure (WBS) templates for
    each iteration, and a WBS template for an end-to-end process.
</p>
<p>
    Iterations may have variable lengths, depending on project characteristics. One-month iterations are typically
    recommended, because this timeframe provides:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        A reasonable amount of time for projects to deliver meaningful increments in functionality.
    </li>
    <li>
        Early and frequent customer feedback.
    </li>
    <li>
        Timely management of risks and issues during the course of the project.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    OpenUP is intended to offer process guidance to small, co-located teams.

    The keyword index provides the ability to look-up topics in the method website based on keywords or topics. At the time
    the pages are created, keywords are identified which allows the keyword index to be built. The top frame of the keyword
    index window allows topics beginning with a letter or number to be displayed. The lower frame displays a list of topics
    and their related links. Clicking on a link causes the related page to be displayed in the main frame of the published

    While the entire purpose of a project is to produce a product, the specific goals of the team will vary substantially
    throughout the project. In the beginning, there usually is considerable latitude in the requirements for the product.
    It may not be clear whether the project is feasible or even if it is likely to be profitable. At that time, it is
    critical to bring an answer to these questions, and of little to no value to start developing the product in
    earnest.&nbsp;Towards the end of the project, the product itself is usually complete, and issues of quality, delivery,
    and completeness then take center stage. At different points in time, tasks are undertaken in new ways and work
    products will have new content.
</p>
<p>
    To coordinate the team’s efforts in a manner that takes these fundamental observations into account, the project
    lifecycle should be divided into a sequence of phases. Each phase has a defined set of goals, its own iteration style
    and customized <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../base_concepts/guidances/termdefinitions/task.html"
    guid="_x459ktnmEdmO6L4XMImrsA">task</a>s and <a class="elementLink"
    href="./../../../base_concepts/guidances/termdefinitions/work_product.html" guid="_H4JXwB_SEdq6CKKKq4D7YA">work
    product</a>s to address the unique needs of the project at that point in time.
</p>
<h3>
    Iteration and Phases
</h3>
<p>
    Each phase is divided into iterations. An iteration is a complete development loop resulting in a build (internal or
    external) of an executable system, usually a subset of the final product under development, which grows incrementally
    from iteration to iteration to become the final product.<br />

    <a id="What_is_DSDM" name="What_is_DSDM">What is DSDM?</a>
</h2>
<p>
    There is increasing pressure on organisations to deliver working systems to business in ever shorter timescales. <b>The
    Framework For Business Centered Development</b> (version 4 of DSDM) describes an iterative and incremental approach to
    developing software that is clearly driven by and responsive to the changing needs of the business. The concept of
    customer collaboration underpins the DSDM way of working. The iterative DSDM development process is designed
    specifically to support a number of collaborative techniques to ensure that a project delivers exactly what is needed
    within the normal constraints of time, budget and resources. The clear definition of a variety of customer roles forms
    part of DSDM and is considered critical to the success of the approach.
</p>
<p>
    Like the Eclipse Foundation, the DSDM Consortium is keen to promote best practice in software development in general
    and to this end is contributing the definition of its customer roles to the OpenUP approach.
</p>
<p>
    As an Agile process, DSDM promotes active user involvement within the project team and defines specific roles that
    enable this. The DSDM Plugin for OpenUP adds these roles to the OpenUP base, increasing the team''s capability for
    collaborative software development.

          <MainDescription><![CDATA[<h3>
    Introduction
</h3>
<p>
    People working together effectively is the foundation of any successful project. DSDM recognises this and assigns clear
    roles and responsibilities to each person in a project, both from the customer and supplier side of the project. These
    two communities work very closely together in DSDM projects - there is no "us and them".
</p>
<p>
    The first part of this section covers the DSDM roles added to OpenUP using this plugin. The rest of the section
    describes how teams operate and are organised in DSDM projects.
</p>
<h3>
    People and Roles in DSDM Projects
</h3>
<p>
    The DSDM roles to be filled are listed above. It is emphasised that these roles do not necessarily relate to
    individuals on a one-to-one basis. One person may cover one or more roles, and a role could be split between one or
    more people.
</p>
<p>
    The roles allow for a large project, split into a number of development teams working concurrently, or at least
    overlapping in terms of the development time frame.
</p>
<p>
    <span>It is understood that such things as geographical constraints and staff availability can impact the setting up of
    the ideal team, but it is strongly recommended that the roles are all considered and their individual responsibilities
    assigned as appropriate. They can be used as the basis for personal terms of reference for the project.</span>
</p>
<h3>
    <a id="Team_dynamics" name="Team_dynamics">Team dynamics</a>
</h3>
<p>
    The main benefits of the DSDM approach arise from users (customers) being closely involved in the development teams. So
    what is the best team structure for a DSDM project to maximise the benefit of user involvement? It is important that
    the team is not too large, ideally no more than six people including users. The users must be allocated the time to
    really get involved, and feel involved, so that they take ownership of the application being built.
</p>
<h3>
    <a id="The_anti-fault_philosophy" name="The_anti-fault_philosophy">The anti-fault philosophy</a>
</h3>
<p>
    Traditionally in IT/IS projects, the functional specification has been used as the final arbiter of what is or is not
    in scope or intended. When the requirements are vague or ambiguous, the way is open for arguments and recriminations as
    to whose fault it is, who should pay, and whether the developer should have known "because it was obvious". Joint
    responsibility and development avoid this, but if traditional roles and ideas are allowed to persist, the dangers are
    greater. If developers and users do not work together as a team and if they adopt their traditional roles and
    positions, there is no detailed specification to refer back to.
</p>
<p>
    It is essential that individual responsibility is understood and taken, but also that, as in any team, if problems do
    develop, it is seen as a team failure rather than an individual''s, and that the team continues to work together to
    resolve the difficulty. Users and developers have equal responsibility for the development.
</p>
<h3>
    <a id="Team_management" name="Team_management">Team management</a>
</h3>
<p>
    In a DSDM team, the issue of how to organise the team structure and management arises. Within a peer team, roles are
    discussed and allocated by the team members based on an appraisal of each individual''s inherent skills, personal
    characteristics and experience.
</p>
<p>
    In general, traditional hierarchical team structures do not encourage the flexible working practices and open
    communications so necessary for the DSDM approach to work, but the team members may decide to adopt any structure that
    works for them. Since DSDM teams are a temporary social structure that must be effective from the very start, extra
    effort in building the team mentality is essential when the team is originally formed. Team-building activities are
    strongly recommended early on and whenever it is necessary to bring in a new team member.
</p>
<p>
    The Project Manager can be from the business or the IT department. However, the basic rules are that the Project
    Manager must:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        understand the business issues
    </li>
    <li>
        empathise with the users
    </li>
    <li>
        understand the technical issues.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The last consideration means that usually Project Managers come from an IT background, as their skills in computer
    system development have been acquired over many years. It is unrealistic to expect user personnel to understand all the
    IT-related issues that have to be addressed, without some direct support from the IT department. <span     style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-fareast-font-family: ''Times New Roman''; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">On
    large projects the Project Manager would not be part of any individual team. The Project manager may also manage more
    than one project concurrently.</span>
</p>
<p>
    One important aspect of the Project Manager role is that of arbitration. Where there is discussion about the relative
    priorities or merits of some aspect of the system under development, the Project Manager does not supply the decision
    but assists the parties involved in deciding the best approach for the project.
</p>
<p>
    Motivating the team should not be too much of a problem in the early stages of the project. However if things start to
    go wrong the impetus to deliver can disappear. User team members are particularly prone to losing their initial
    enthusiasm, since they are not so inured to the many setbacks that can face an IT project. To avoid this, the team
    should plan for social activities that enable the team to get together and talk about things other than work.

    <li>
        Focus the team on delivering&nbsp;functionality that&nbsp;meets business needs

          <MainDescription><![CDATA[<h3>
    Typical Phase by Phase Activities
</h3>
<h4>
    Pre-Project
</h4>
<p>
    Although DSDM has a formal pre-project phase, OpenUP does not. Nevertheless, there are important activities that need
    to be undertaken before a project can be started. The Executive Sponsor is key in ensuring that these are completed.
    You can use this extract from DSDM as a form of checklist for starting Inception.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Determine the need for the project and that is in line with the business strategy.
    </li>
    <li>
        Allocate someone to the <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../dsdm_openup/roles/visionary.html"
        guid="_hQJ-QFkVEdul8L-IGeA7TA">Visionary</a> role for the duration of the project.
    </li>
    <li>
        Obtain initial funding for the Inception Phase.
    </li>
    <li>
        Agree the approach to project governance with the relevant parts of the organisation.
    </li>
    <li>
        Commit the necessary business resources to the Inception Phase, e.g. especially <a class="elementLink"
        href="./../../../dsdm_openup/roles/ambassador_user.html" guid="_ctbZ8FkVEdul8L-IGeA7TA">Ambassador User</a> and
        <u><a class="elementLink" href="./../../../dsdm_openup/roles/advisor_user.html"
        guid="_avOA0FkVEdul8L-IGeA7TA">Advisor User</a></u>(s)&nbsp;as requested by the <a class="elementLink"
        href="./../../../openup_basic/roles/project_manager.html" guid="_0a0o0MlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">Project Manager</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
        Ensure that planning, co-ordination and management responsibilities for both the IT/IS project and any associated
        business change are clearly assigned to the relevant people.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    Inception Phase
</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        Monitor project governance.
    </li>
    <li>
        Respond to issues escalated by the Visionary.
    </li>
    <li>
        Review/approve the <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../openup_basic/workproducts/risk_list.html"
        guid="_Ckay8Cc_EduIsqH1Q6ZuqA">Risk List</a>.
    </li>
    <li>

        guid="_0a6vcMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">Project Plan</a> (or not: the project can stop here if no viable solution is
        possible).
    </li>
    <li>
        Commit the necessary business resources to the&nbsp;next phase&nbsp;of the project.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    Elaboration Phase
</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        Monitor project governance.
    </li>
    <li>
        Respond to issues escalated by the Visionary.
    </li>
    <li>
        Review/approve the Risk List.
    </li>
    <li>
        Approve the Business Case for the project to proceed beyond the&nbsp;Elaboration Phase&nbsp;and obtain funding as
        necessary.
    </li>
    <li>
        Review/agree the&nbsp;Project Plan (or not).
    </li>
    <li>
        This is a major go/no go decision point in the project.
    </li>
    <li>
        Commit the necessary business resources to the rest of the project.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    Construction Phase
</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        Monitor project governance.
    </li>
    <li>
        Respond to issues escalated by the Visionary.
    </li>
    <li>
        Review/approve the Risk List.
    </li>
    <li>

    </li>
    <li>
        Commit the necessary business resources to the rest of the project.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    Transition Phase
</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        Monitor project governance.
    </li>
    <li>
        Respond to issues escalated by the Visionary.
    </li>
    <li>
        Review/approve the Risk&nbsp;List.
    </li>
    <li>
        Sign off the delivered system.
    </li>
    <li>
        Determine whether or not the project is to deliver another increment or stop now.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    Post-Project
</h4>
<p>
    This occurs after the final Transition iteration.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Ensure that the Post-Project Review is run if appropriate to the size of project - especially to prove that the
        Business Case has been achieved.

    ensure that the right system is built for the business. This does not necessarily imply a senior position within the

          <KeyConsiderations><![CDATA[<p>
    Ambassador Users must be representative of the entire community of users. The whole user community should see them as
    such - not just the user management. They must have authority delegated to them to make decisions and to guide the work
    of the developers. This is particularly important when considering changes of scope due to time limitations.
</p>]]></KeyConsiderations>
          <AssignmentApproaches>&lt;p>
    Ambassador Users should have a positive attitude towards the development since they will be exposed to a whole raft of
    new ideas and technologies that can be daunting.
&lt;/p>

    For some critical projects, it may be necessary for Ambassador Users to be on the project full-time, but this is often
    not possible and may even be counter-productive.&lt;/span> It is perfectly acceptable for an Ambassador User to be
    part-time. However, the presence on the project needs to be continuous, e.g. at specified times of the day and/or on

    The Visionary is a business role. The Visionary is the one who is usually responsible for getting a project started
    through enthusiasm and commitment to the idea and business goals. The Visionary should remain involved throughout the
    design and delivery process to ensure the original objectives are being met. If any issues arise during the project,
    which must be considered by higher management, the Visionary will either provide the decision or provide higher
    management with the business viewpoint.
</p>
<p>
    The Visionary role ensures the project excellence from the business point of view and the Technical Co-ordinator does
    the same from the technical point of view.

          <KeyConsiderations><![CDATA[<p>
    The Visionary has the high-level view of the original reasons for initiating the project: this must not be dissipated
    during development. Unfortunately, this happens in many projects. It is very easy once development is under way to
    involve only those staff who will use the computer system on a day-to-day basis but who, perhaps, do not fully
    understand all the business vision. This can result in a dilution of the original goals and a tendency towards simply
    re-specifying the system to be replaced. It is imperative that the Visionary is present when important user events
    occur or when management decisions about the progress of the project are made.
</p>
<p>
    The Visionary must commit business staff to the project as <a class="elementLink" href="./../../dsdm_openup/roles/ambassador_user.html" guid="_ctbZ8FkVEdul8L-IGeA7TA">Ambassador User</a>(s). These people should be available to the project on a continuous basis throughout the life of the project -
    not necessarily full-time but "contracts" for the Ambassador Users time should be agreed with the <a class="elementLink" href="./../../openup_basic/roles/project_manager.html" guid="_0a0o0MlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">Project Manager</a> before leaving the Business Study phase, e.g. "Ambassador User X

          <MainDescription><![CDATA[<p>
    DSDM is a vendor-independent method that recognises that more projects fail because of people issues than technology.
    The focus is on helping people to work effectively together to achieve the business goals. DSDM is also tool and
    technique independent enabling it to be used in any business and technical environment without tying the method users
    to any particular vendor.
</p>
<p>
    Many system development projects fail to meet the expectations of the end users. Such project failures can be
    classified into one of five basic types:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        The system fails to meet the business requirements for which it was developed. The system is either abandoned or
        expensive adaptive maintenance is undertaken.
    </li>
    <li>
        There are performance shortcomings in the system, which make it inadequate for the users'' needs. Again, it is
        either abandoned or amended incurring extra costs.
    </li>
    <li>
        Errors appear in the developed system causing unexpected problems. Patches have to be applied at extra cost.
    </li>
    <li>
        Users reject the imposition of the system, for political reasons, lack of involvement in its development or lack of
        commitment to it.
    </li>
    <li>
        Systems are initially accepted but over time become impossible to maintain and so pass into disuse.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    DSDM aims to prevent all five types of project failure.
</p>
<p>
    A fundamental assumption of the DSDM approach is that <strong>nothing is built perfectly first time</strong>, but that
    80% of the solution can be produced in 20% of the time that it would take to produce the total solution. A basic
    problem with less agile approaches is the expectation that potential system users can predict what all their
    requirements will be at some distant point in time. This problem is compounded by the fact that the mere existence of a
    new system affects the users'' requirements because the methods of working have changed.
</p>
<p>
    In the classical, sequential (or "waterfall") approach, the next step cannot be started until the previous step is
    completed and fully tested. In practice, a lot of time is spent in getting from the 80% solution to the total solution,
    with the assumption that no step ever needs to be revisited. This means that considerable time is spent going back to
    "completed" steps and unravelling the defects from work that has previously been accepted. The result is that projects
    are delivered late and over budget or they fail to meet the business needs since time is not spent reworking the
    requirements.
</p>
<p>
    DSDM assumes that all previous steps can be revisited as part of its iterative approach. Therefore, <strong>the current
    step need be completed only enough to move to the next step</strong>, since it can be finished in a later iteration.
    The premise is that the business requirements are likely to change anyway as understanding increases, so any further
    work would have been wasted!
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Systems built using the DSDM approach address the current and imminent needs of the business</strong> rather
    than the traditional approach of attacking all the perceived possibilities. The resulting system is, therefore,
    expected to be a better fit to the true business needs, be easier to test and be more likely to be accepted into the
    users'' working practices. Since the development cost of most applications is only a small part of the total lifecycle
    costs, it makes sense to build simpler systems that are fit for purpose and easier to maintain and modify after their
    initial development. The latter is possible since maintenance can be treated as a further incremental delivery towards
    the total solution.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>DSDM is not only about developing new systems</strong>. Enhancements to existing systems can be created using
    DSDM.

          <MainDescription><![CDATA[<p>
    In 1999, Rational Software and the DSDM Consortium collaborated to produce a RUP/DSDM interoperability paper (see "<a class="elementLink" href="./../../../dsdm_openup/guidances/whitepapers/dsdm_rup.html" guid="_6LZh8FlkEdu-hcil0jQ6jA">DSDM and the Rational Unified Process</a>"). Much of that paper remains relevant when
    considering using DSDM with OpenUP. The following excerpt is particularly appropriate.
</p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    <p>
        To quote the DSDM Manual,<br />
         “DSDM is more a framework than a method. It does not say how things should be done in detail, but provides a
        skeleton process and product descriptions that are to be tailored to suit a particular project or a particular
        organisation”.
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">
    In this sense, OpenUP complements DSDM by providing detailed guidance for the technical aspects of software
    development.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Further, the paper notes that
</p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    <p dir="ltr">
        "It was suggested in an early meeting of the team that DSDM was a paradigm – you can approach software development
        with a DSDM frame of mind, almost regardless of the process...If you are a RUP user and need to adopt a
        business-centred RAD approach then DSDM will provide many useful techniques...<strong>In an ideal world it would be
        nice to have all these techniques defined in a shopping basket or tool kit from which you could pick the
        appropriate techniques regardless of the process being utilised.</strong>" (<em>original emphasis</em>)
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">
    The Eclipse Process Framework in general - and Method Composer in particular - provide such a tool kit.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    OpenUP/Basic defines a process that is minimal and complete from a technical team perspective. DSDM, like many Agile
    methods, promotes active user involvement on a project. OpenUP provides for this with a minimalistic definition of the
    Stakeholder role. The DSDM Plugin for OpenUP extends this Stakeholder role by adding four business roles and assigns
    them specific responsibilities for key aspects of the project. These roles are;
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Executive Sponsor
    </li>
    <li>
        Visionary
    </li>
    <li>
        Ambassador User
    </li>
    <li>
        Advisor User
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    These roles are applied to OpenUP in a complementary fashion. For simplicity, the DSDM roles have been applied to
    existing Tasks and Products - no new tasks or products have been introduced to OpenUP in this plugin.
</p>
<p>
    The addition of these roles to OpenUP promotes an&nbsp; <span     style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-fareast-font-family: ''Times New Roman''; mso-bidi-font-family: ''Times New Roman''; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">explicitly</span>
    collaborative approach , where software development responsibility is shared by the business and technical communities.
    It is the experience of DSDM practitioners and the wider Agile community that this significantly enhances the potential
    for a successful project.

    DSDM aims not only to prevent failure but to bring success, by delivering systems that:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        satisfy the real requirements of business, in order of importance
    </li>
    <li>
        support the way the business needs to work
    </li>
    <li>
        are delivered on time and within budget
    </li>
    <li>
        are delivered quickly, and yet are robust and right (e.g. the right level of quality, the right functionality, the
        right performance, security and maintainability).
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Solutions built with DSDM&nbsp;do not focus purely on speed&nbsp;at the expense of quality. DSDM focuses on the
    priorities of the business and delivers what can safely be delivered within the time and cost constraints of the
    project, in priority order determined by the business needs and the objectives of the project.<br />

    using DSDM</a>
</h4>
<p>
    Using an iterative process based on prototyping, DSDM involves the system''s end-users throughout the project lifecycle.
    This has many benefits, for example:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        the users are more likely to claim ownership of the system
    </li>
    <li>
        the risk of building the wrong system is greatly reduced
    </li>
    <li>
        the final system is more likely to meet the users'' real business requirements
    </li>
    <li>
        the users will be better trained, since their representatives will define and co-ordinate the training required
    </li>
    <li>
        implementation is more likely to go smoothly, because of the co-operation of all parties concerned throughout
        development.
    </li>

          <MainDescription><![CDATA[<P>The full DSDM product provides a framework for development projects that encompasses all aspects for successful delivery: people, process and technology - with the emphasis on people, since more projects fail because of some people-based problem than for any other reason. </P>
<P>The framework is based on nine DSDM Underlying Principles&nbsp;that enable projects to deliver what the organisation needs when it needs it. </P>
<P>The framework defines a set of phases that any new/changing system (IT or business) will pass through - from initial identification of a problem or opportunity to be addressed through the development of the new/changed system to keeping the system operating successfully. These are described in the DSDM Process Overview. </P>
<P>Various DSDM Products are produced within each phase. These are defined to a level that enables them to be used in any development environment. </P>
<P>As stated above, the people aspects are essential, so DSDM defines key roles and responsibilities for people working inside and alongside the development. </P>
<P>Every project will have the need for management techniques to control the process, such as good project planning, risk management, quality management. DSDM provides guidance on management techniques focussing on aspects of control that are specific to fast-moving development work. The Management Techniques section covers all the essentials needed for a controlled and yet flexible approach. </P>
<P>Management is not the complete answer, the people within a project will be carrying out various activities from identifying how to create the solution to the business problem or opportunity through building and testing the solution to putting it into operation. <SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">DSDM has several core Development Techniques that assist the project team in these activities.<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /><o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P>DSDM recognises that every project is unique. Hence, a list of factors to consider when starting a DSDM project are provided in the When to Use DSDM section together with a Suitability Risk/List for ascertaining early in the project what aspects may cause problems later. Moreover, projects come in all sizes and guises, so guidance on Tailoring DSDM for specific projects is also provided. </P>
<P>Lastly for those organisations (or parts of organisations) that have never used DSDM before, guidance is provided about Introducing DSDM into an organisation. </P>]]></MainDescription>

</p>
<p>
    DSDM is a vendor-independent method that recognises that more projects fail because of people issues than technology.
    The focus is on helping people to work effectively together to achieve the business goals. DSDM is also tool and
    technique independent, enabling it to be used in any business and technical environment without tying the method users
    to any particular vendor.
</p>
<p>
    DSDM is published, maintained and continuously improved by the DSDM Consortium (<a href="http://www.dsdm.org/" target="_blank">www.dsdm.org</a>), a not-for-profit organisation dedicated to the promotion of best practice for
    software development and Agile project management.
</p>
<p>
    A fundamental assumption of the DSDM approach is that <b>nothing is built perfectly first time</b>, but that 80% of the
    solution can be produced in 20% of the time that it would take to produce the total solution. A basic problem with less
    agile approaches is the expectation that potential system users can predict what all their requirements will be at some
    distant point in time. This problem is compounded by the fact that the mere existence of a new system affects the
    users'' requirements because the methods of working have changed.
</p>
<p>
    In the classical, sequential (or "waterfall") approach, the next step cannot be started until the previous step is
    completed and fully tested. In practice, a lot of time is spent in getting from the 80% solution to the total solution,
    with the assumption that no step ever needs to be revisited. This means that considerable time is spent going back to
    "completed" steps and unravelling the defects from work that has previously been accepted. The result is that projects
    are delivered late and over budget or they fail to meet the business needs since time is not spent reworking the
    requirements.
</p>
<p>
    DSDM assumes that all previous steps can be revisited as part of its iterative approach. Therefore, <b>the current step
    need be completed only enough to move to the next step</b>, since it can be finished in a later iteration. The premise
    is that the business requirements are likely to change anyway as understanding increases, so any further work would
    have been wasted!
</p>
<p>
    <b>Systems built using the DSDM approach address the current and imminent needs of the business</b> rather than the
    traditional approach of attacking all the perceived possibilities. The resulting system is, therefore, expected to
    better fit to the true business needs, be easier to test and be more likely to be accepted into the users'' working
    practices. Since the development cost of most applications is only a small part of the total lifecycle costs, it makes
    sense to build simpler systems that are fit for purpose and easier to maintain and modify after their initial
    development. The latter is possible since maintenance can be treated as a further incremental delivery towards the
    total solution.

          <MainDescription><![CDATA[<p>
    Traditionally, if the system fails to meet the requirements as set out in the specification, it is the fault of the
    developers or, if the system meets the specification but is actually of little use to the business, it is the fault of
    the customers. It is rarely viewed as a joint responsibility.
</p>
<p>
    Because of the technical nature of their work, IT staff use a language that is adapted for their particular needs.
    Similarly, the customers have their own jargon, which is often less arcane than that of IT but still creates a
    communications barrier.
</p>
<p>
    DSDM uses collaborative techniques to surmount these problems. The strong focus on collaboration in DSDM projects
    enables a ‘no blame’ culture that eliminates much of the lack of understanding between customers and suppliers to
    create a win-win environment.
</p>
<p>
    Collaborative approaches and mechanisms include:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Senior management commitment to strong and continuing business involvement during the project, i.e.
        customers&nbsp;as an integral part of&nbsp;development teams.
    </li>
    <li>
        Facilitated workshops throughout the lifecycle (not just for requirements capture and reviews) to capture the
        broader business and technical views so achieving consensus at crucial steps in the process.
    </li>
    <li>
        Evolutionary prototyping, i.e. partial system builds that are driven by and regularly reviewed by the customers.
    </li>
    <li>
        Partitioning the responsibility for work products so that the knowledge of the team members is used. appropriately,
        e.g. the customer focus create help text that really means something to the users of the system.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    From the above it is clear that the ability to collaborate changes the way people work and therefore introduces new
    responsibilities to all roles. This plug-in to OpenUP provides some help towards effective collaboration through the
    inclusion of the DSDM&nbsp;business roles and responsibilities that are relevant to OpenUP.

    <a id="Introduction" name="Introduction">Introduction</a>
</h3>
<p>
    Facilitated Workshops have been used in business and systems development in particular for years. Initially they were
    used for JRP (Joint Requirements Planning) and JAD (Joint Application Design) but their usefulness was quickly seen in
    other areas.
</p>
<p>
    They are a core technique in DSDM for speed and efficiency as a way of making high quality team-based decisions in
    short timescales.
</p>
<p>
    <span>&#160;Whether they are used for DSDM or any other business project, they are run in the same way. This section
    examines how the approach maps directly onto DSDM and where in DSDM they can be used. It seeks to show the potential of
    possible use of Facilitated Workshops in a DSDM project, rather than mandate their use at any particular point. It is
    up to the project members themselves to decide whether a workshop is necessary, or whether another technique, such as
    interviewing or research is more applicable.</span>
</p>
<p>
    Used properly, Facilitated Workshops are a useful tool for effecting cultural change in an organisation because they
    promote buy-in from and empowerment of participants. When used effectively, they can set the tone for the whole
    project.
</p>
<p>
    Note: It is not intended to explain here how to set up and run facilitated workshops but to show how the technique can
    be applied to DSDM projects.
</p>
<h3>
    <a id="What_are_Facilitated_Workshops" name="What_are_Facilitated_Workshops">What are Facilitated Workshops?</a>
</h3>
<h4>
    Definition
</h4>
<p>
    A facilitated workshop is a structured approach to ensure that a group of people can reach a predetermined objective in
    a compressed timeframe, supported by an impartial facilitator.
</p>
<h4>
    Benefits
</h4>
<p>
    Using Facilitated Workshops brings both direct and indirect benefits to a project.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Rapid, quality decision-making.</strong> Because all stakeholders are present at the same time, there is
        great confidence in the result. The group is focused on the objectives to be achieved in the session so that the
        information gathering and review cycle is performed at a greater speed. Also, misunderstandings and disagreements
        can be worked out at the time. Any concerns should therefore have been raised and resolved or noted by the end of
        the workshop.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Greater user buy-in.</strong> Workshops, run effectively, lead to participants feeling more involved in the
        project and decisions being made. They build and maintain enthusiasm.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Building team spirit.</strong>&#160;Facilitated workshops&#160;are a controlled way of building rapport as
        well as delivering the primary objectives of the workshop.&#160;They can promote understanding and co-operation
        between departments, which is particularly important when a development involves many groups.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Process redesign by the user community</strong> If practices are reviewed as a result of a workshop,
        participants gain a greater understanding of the inputs and implications of their work. This leads to improved
        efficiencies that are&#160;driven by the participants themselves, giving greater buy-in and commitment and
        therefore a greater chance of successful implementation.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Clarification of requirements when they are unclear</strong> Business users can be led through their
        objectives and processes to define what they may require. In the facilitated environment, participants can explore
        and model ideas. This is successful through a combination of structured discussion and the presence of
        knowledgeable participants.<br />

<p>
    This section gives some guidance on which DSDM roles would fill the roles of a workshop. These are defined as being
    Workshop Owner, Facilitator, Participants, Scribe and Observer.<br />
    <br />
</p>
<h5>
    Workshop Owner
</h5>
<p>
    This is the owner of the problem that the workshop is set to solve. It is up to them to set the objectives and
    deliverables of the workshop, although these should also be agreed by the participants.
</p>
<p>
    The owner of a Feasibility Study workshop could well be the Executive Sponsor whereas the owner of a timebox planning
    session could be the Project Manager or Team Leader or even the Ambassador User.
</p>
<h5>
    <a id="Facilitator" name="Facilitator"></a>Facilitator
</h5>
<p>
    The Facilitator should be impartial, with no stake in the outcome of the workshop, and therefore should come from
    outside the project. The Facilitator maps directly onto the DSDM role.
</p>
<h5>
    Participant
</h5>
<p>
    Participants represent the views of the project stakeholders (e.g. the business and software development community).
    They are the individuals who are knowledgeable in the areas under consideration. They manage and operate the system and
    include managers, supervisors, clerical staff, and IT staff.
</p>
<p>
    A participant could be one of many roles within the business or IT side. They could be a business user, a customer, a
    supplier, a business analyst or data modeller or systems architect, a member of the financial staff, an auditor, or
    indeed any of the core DSDM or specialist roles.
</p>
<h5>
    Observer
</h5>
<p>
    Observers are not allowed to contribute towards the output of the workshop. If they need to take part at all, they
    should be Participants. Examples of the use of an Observer are therefore limited but could include someone auditing the
    workshop process or the facilitator''s ability, or a trainee facilitator who would want to observe the group dynamics
    without being part of the group. Observers could also be development or support staff gathering useful background, but
    in these cases it should be checked whether they should really be contributing to the session.
</p>
<h5>
    <a id="Scribe" name="Scribe"></a>Scribe
</h5>
<p>
    The Scribe records what is happening within the workshop. The role could be held by a co-facilitator, a business
    analyst, developer or user so long as the individual has the required understanding of the issues in order to know what
    to record. There may be two Scribes in a workshop. For example, one of the Developers might use a CASE tool to directly
    model what''s being discussed while another scribe takes down the discussion notes for later reference.
</p>
<h4>
    Applying the DSDM principles
</h4>
<p>
    Facilitated Workshops are like a DSDM project in miniature with defined deliverables in a tight timescale and empowered
    users. Early workshops can build the foundation for this approach to continue throughout the project. This list below
    shows how the DSDM Principles apply in Facilitated Workshops.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Active user involvement is imperative.</strong> Workshops provide an ideal format for the business to be
        directly involved in planning, designing and implementing a solution.<br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>DSDM teams must be empowered to make decisions.</strong> Workshop participants need to be empowered and
        have the right level of knowledge and authority within the scope of the workshop, so that decisions can be made
        without delay.<br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>The focus is on frequent delivery of products.</strong> It is good practice to structure a workshop so that
        there are intermediate deliverables. It helps to order participants'' thinking as they progress in logical steps.
        This enables them to work towards an ultimate goal and gives them a growing sense of achievement as the workshop
        progresses.<br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Fitness for purpose is the essential criterion for acceptance of deliverables.</strong> The Facilitator
        checks that fitness for purpose is achieved by keeping participants focused on delivery against an agreed set of
        objectives. They ensure all are involved in decision-making.<br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Iterative and incremental prototyping is necessary to converge on an accurate business solution.</strong>
        One of the strengths of workshops is the synergy achieved by the group. Ideas do not have to be born fully
        developed but can grow during discussion. In effect, they are being prototyped. It is an ideal setting to try out
        ideas with all stakeholders and it is up to the facilitator to provide a safe environment in which this may
        happen.<br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>All changes during development are reversible.</strong> Information and decisions should be recorded as
        necessary by either one or both of the facilitator and scribe so that ideas can be backtracked where necessary.
        Often what happens in practice is that an idea or decision is redeveloped.<br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Requirements are baselined at a high level.</strong> Objectives must be set during the preparation for a
        workshop. As the workshop progresses, information is gathered, analysed and interpreted so that discussion can be
        effective and a decision reached as a result of an increased understanding of the issues involved.<br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Testing is integrated throughout the lifecycle.</strong> Because all stakeholders are present, this
        provides the quality control approach of testing ideas and deliverables as they are discussed. Participants have
        the opportunity to challenge or agree.<br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>A collaborative and co-operative approach between all stakeholders is essential.</strong> The facilitator
        is responsible for creating the climate of co-operation within the workshop and enforcing any ground rules for the
        group to behave effectively. This is only possible with the co-operation and commitment of all stakeholders. It is
        an effective way of achieving either compromise or consensus.
    </li>
</ul>

</h4>
<p>
    The list below gives suggestions for the types of workshop that could be run during a project. Some of them could be
    combined and become sessions within a longer workshop. Depending on the size and complexity of the problems being
    addressed, it may not be necessary to obtain answers and decisions through a formal workshop although workshop
    techniques could still be used in an interactive session. The duration of workshops varies from project to project.

                    Workshops should be run by skilled facilitators. They should be impartial to the issues under
                    discussion with no stake in the outcome. An ineffective facilitator can bias a workshop or at worst
                    lead to its failure. It is a highly skilled role requiring sensitivity, diplomacy, quick thinking and
                    highly developed communication skills. The role of the Facilitator is not one to be taken lightly. It
                    is a skilled job and is instrumental in ensuring a workshop is successful. One way to ensure an
                    effective facilitator is to use one who has been accredited by&#160;GlobalNF (<a href="http://www.globalfn.org/" target="_blank">www.globalfn.org</a>).

    The role of the Facilitator is to concentrate on the workshop process so that all participants have an equal
    opportunity to contribute. The main task of the Facilitator is to deal with all of the "people" aspects of the
    workshops by getting participants to work as a team. The Facilitator documents results and decisions on flip-charts,
    for example, that act as "group memory". The Facilitator does not contribute to the content of the workshop.

          <MainDescription><![CDATA[The nature of DSDM projects means that low-level requirements are not necessarily fixed when the developers are originally
approached to carry out the work. Hence the short-term direction that a project takes must be quickly decided without
recourse to restrictive change control procedures. The stakeholders include not only the business and development staff
within the project, but also other staff such as Service Delivery or resource managers. 
<p>
    When development is procured from an external supplier, both the vendor and the purchaser organisations should aim for
    as efficient a process as possible while allowing for flexibility during both the pre-contract phase and when the
    contracted work is carried out.

                <Description>Avoid rushing into defining the solution. First, gain agreement on the definition of the problem by asking the stakeholders&#xD;

Each one is applicable in a particular&#xD;
    situation or to a certain type of stakeholder.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If you can meet stakeholders in person, then you can conduct an interview or a brainstorming session. This face to face&#xD;
    collaboration is extremely valuable and reduces the chances of the project team misunderstanding the needs of the&#xD;
    stakeholders.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Some requirements may already be documented in an existing Work Item List. This can often be used as a solid starting&#xD;
    position from which a full set of requirements can be created.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Any requirements gathered during this step should be captured in the Work Item List.&#xD;

    project.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If the project is feature-driven, the team looks at how many people they would need to complete these work items, which&#xD;
    gives them a high level understanding of project duration, staffing profile, and scope.&amp;nbsp;If the project instead is&#xD;
    date-driven, the team assesses how much work can roughly be done in the time-frame given and using the available team.&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Responses may include avoiding or mitigating risks, exploring opportunities or increasing the probability and positive&#xD;
    impacts of the risk. Depending on the case, work items may have to be added or removed from the Work Items List to make&#xD;
    sure that responses will be prioritized and handled by the team along with project work. As it is not feasible to plan&#xD;
    responses for all risks identified, the team can decide to accept some of them. Risks to watch will be communicated to&#xD;
    stakeholders and remain on the Risk List and actions will be determined only if they occur.&#xD;

              <Step name="Outline project lifecycle" briefDescription="" id="_sWzfgOeUEdusqr8cJFUf_w" orderingGuide="" presentationName="" suppressed="false" sectionName="" variabilityType="na">
                <Description>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Define the iteration length and use it to assess target velocity (see &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;

    Estimation&lt;/a>). The number of items to be delivered in each iteration will be set by the velocity of the team and the&#xD;
    estimates for each item. The team uses the Work Items List to outline what features to implement in what iteration,&#xD;
    putting top priority work items first, including planned responses to the higher risks or opportunities.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    OpenUP organizes iterations into a set of phases. Each phase in the project lifecycle will end with a milestone aimed&#xD;
    at providing stakeholders with&amp;nbsp;oversight and steering mechanisms to control project funding, scope, risk exposure,&#xD;
    value provided, and other aspects of the process (see &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;

    Lifecycle&lt;/a>)&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    You don''t need to spend too much time in doing this planning. The Project plan should document only&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;a brief&#xD;
    summary of&amp;nbsp; project milestones&amp;nbsp;and 1-3 objectives for each iteration. Do not commit individual work items to&#xD;
    the plan, since this will force too much re-planning. The goal is just to create a high-level plan outlining&#xD;
    how&amp;nbsp;the team&amp;nbsp;can build the resulting application in the given set of iterations. Extra level of detail will&#xD;
    be achieved in other planning sessions throughout the project (see &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;

    round of planning should keep things very rough and flexible. The goal is just to articulate value against the budget&#xD;
    constraints of the project and help stakeholders to decide whether it''s worth moving forward with the project or not.&#xD;
    If necessary propose options to decrease costs, such as removing from the scope low value and high cost work items.&#xD;

                <Description>Plan the strategy for deploying the software (and its updates) into the production environment. Discuss release timeframe&#xD;
with the operations and support departments to ensure that your project fits into your overall corporate deployment system.&#xD;
If you are replacing an existing system, decide whether you will run the new system in parallel with it or you will perform&#xD;
a cutover. You may also have to negotiate with the owners of the systems that the new system has dependencies on. Update&#xD;
the Work Items List with additional work that may be needed for deployment. Add significant deployment risks to the Risk&#xD;

    The project manager needs to do the following:&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        continuously monitor the project to ensure it is progressing appropriately&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        enable the team to react as soon as possible to any change&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Many alternative means may be used to track the status. Quick, daily meetings with the entire project team are useful&#xD;
    to understand what team members have accomplished since the&amp;nbsp;last meeting, and what they plan to accomplish before&#xD;
    the next meeting. It also allows the team to identify any blocking issues. See &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../openup/guidances/guidelines/daily_meetings.html&quot; guid=&quot;_251UMCmREdyy6Oss2-0s1g&quot;>Guideline: Daily&#xD;
    Meetings&lt;/a>.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Another approach is the collection of basic metrics, ideally automatically generated from the tools at hand, or&#xD;
    manually assembled. &lt;span&#xD;

    charts are one of the most useful project progress metrics. They show how many work items where accomplished during&#xD;
    previous iterations (or days) and the remaining work. They can be used to track project releases and iterations&#xD;
    (see&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot; href=&quot;./../../openup/guidances/reports/project_burndown.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;_ePrt8Dj3EduxovfWMDsntw&quot;>Report: Project Burndown&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;and &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;

    Burndown&lt;/a>).&amp;nbsp;Communicating project status is as important as gathering it. Keep the information visible to&#xD;
    stakeholders and project team at all times.&lt;/span> The &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../openup/workproducts/project_plan.html&quot; guid=&quot;_0a6vcMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw&quot;>Artifact: Project&#xD;

                <Description>&lt;p>&#xD;
    One of the project manager''s key responsibilities is to know about the project team''s problems and issues. The manager&#xD;
    needs to focus on problems that are blocking progress. A quick, daily meeting is usually a good way to monitor those&#xD;
    problems and issues.&amp;nbsp;A record of issues that have to be solved within the team may be kept in the &lt;a&#xD;
    class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../openup/workproducts/iteration_plan.html&quot; guid=&quot;_0aQBEslgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw&quot;>Iteration&#xD;
    Plan&lt;/a>&lt;font color=&quot;#003399&quot;>.&lt;/font>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Identify the cause and impact of problems and exceptions as they arise. Identify possible solutions for problems that&#xD;
    have an immediate impact on the short-term goals and objectives and identify who needs to be involved in implementing&#xD;
    the solution. Then, define the corrective actions and implement them.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p></Description>

                <Description>&lt;p>&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
    Identify risks as soon as the project starts and continue identifying and managing risks throughout the project.

The&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
    entire team should be involved in identifying and mitigating risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;/p></Description>

              <Step name="Manage objectives" briefDescription="" id="_Br6VECuxEdqTIKp3l5PtzQ" orderingGuide="" presentationName="" suppressed="false" sectionName="" variabilityType="na">
                <Description>When a team is falling significantly behind, or critical problems occur, that prevents the team&amp;nbsp;from meeting the&#xD;
iteration objectives it may be necessary to descope work to ensure that the team delivers a useful product increment by the&#xD;
end of the iteration, while maximizing stakeholder value. The project manager should work with the team and&#xD;
stakeholders&amp;nbsp;to revise the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../openup/workproducts/iteration_plan_B46FED39.html&quot; guid=&quot;_0aQBEslgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw&quot;>Iteration Plan&lt;/a> and, as necessary, reduce the emphasis on less critical tasks postponing&#xD;
them to a subsequent iteration. In rare cases, if the iteration objectives still seem impossible to be met, the team might&#xD;
consider terminating the iteration or reformulating the iteration to a new objective.</Description>

    requirements are detailed prior to commencing implementation. Rather, this activity is performed throughout the
    lifecycle with <a class="elementLink" href="./../../openup_basic/roles/stakeholder.html" guid="_dTa6gMAYEdqX-s4mWhkyqQ">Stakeholder</a>s and the entire development team collaborating to ensure that a clear,
    consistent, correct, verifiable, and feasible&nbsp;set of requirements&nbsp;is available, as needed, to drive
    implementation and verification.
</p>
<p>
    During Inception, the focus is on&nbsp;gaining agreement on&nbsp;the problem to be solved, gathering stakeholder needs
    and capturing high-level system features&nbsp;(see activity <a class="elementLink" href="./../../dsdm_openup/capabilitypatterns/dsdm_initiate_project.html" guid="_fQhC51nzEdug9t_2UE7UhQ">Initiate Project</a>).
</p>
<p>
    During Elaboration, the focus shifts to defining the solution. This consists of&nbsp;finding those requirements that
    have most value to stakeholders, that are particularly challenging or risky, or that are architecturally significant
    (See <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../openup_basic/tasks/find_and_outline_requirements.html" guid="_P9cMUPV_EdmdHa9MmVPgqQ">Task: Find and Outline Requirements</a>).&nbsp;Requirements&nbsp;that
    are&nbsp;prioritized, via the <a class="elementLink" href="./../../openup_basic/workproducts/work_items_list.html" guid="_rGNWsCbSEdqh1LYUOGRh2A">Work Items List</a>,&nbsp;for implementation in the early iterations are then described
    in sufficient detail to validate the development teams understanding of the requirements, to ensure concurrence with
    stakeholders, and to permit software development to begin (see <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../openup_basic/tasks/detail_requirements.html" guid="_0e1mIMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">Task: Detail Requirements</a>). For each of these requirements, associated test cases are defined to ensure that the
    requirements are verifiable and to provide the guidance needed for verification and validation (see <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../openup_basic/tasks/create_test_case.html" guid="_0iwc0clgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">Task: Create Test Cases</a>).
</p>
<p>
    During Construction, the focus shifts to refining the system definition<em>.</em> This consists of detailing the
    remaining requirements and associated test cases as needed to drive implementation and verification, and managing
    requirements change (see&nbsp;activity <a class="elementLink" href="./../../openup_basic/capabilitypatterns/ongoing_tasks-2.html" guid="_0pJ_xslgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">Ongoing Tasks</a>).

    Use various techniques to make gathering requirements easier. Face-to-face meetings with stakeholders is the most&#xD;
    effective way to understand stakeholder needs and to gather and validate requirements, but you must prepare in order&#xD;
    for these meetings to run efficiently.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Be prepared by gathering and reviewing information related to the problem domain, problem statement, business&#xD;
    environment and key stakeholders. Most of this information should be available in the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot; href=&quot;./../../openup/workproducts/vision_2E71B03C.html&quot; guid=&quot;_0WVxcMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw&quot;>Artifact: Vision&lt;/a>.&amp;nbsp; Review the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot; href=&quot;./../../openup/workproducts/work_items_list_39D03CC8.html&quot; guid=&quot;_rGNWsCbSEdqh1LYUOGRh2A&quot;>Artifact: Work Items List&lt;/a> for stakeholder requests.&#xD;

    Requirements can be broadly classified as either functional or non-functional requirements. The former specify what the&#xD;
    system must do. The latter specify constraints on the solution such as usability, reliability, performance,&#xD;
    supportability, interfaces with legacy systems, etc. Depending upon the domain there may be regulatory requirements&#xD;
    that apply.&#xD;

              <MainDescription><![CDATA[<p>
    The goal of this activity is to&nbsp;define a technical approach to the system that&nbsp;supports the project
    requirements,&nbsp;within the constraints placed on the system and the development team. The architect should do the
    following:&nbsp;
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Work with the team to create an initial sketch of the&nbsp;technical approach to&nbsp;the proposed system
    </li>
    <li>
        Ensure that the technical decisions are adequately captured and communicated
    </li>
    <li>
        Ensure that the team has enough information to understand the approach being taken
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The work done here does not seek to produce a detailed and comprehensive technical specification for the&nbsp;system.
    Rather, the approach should be to decide the overall technical approach at a high level.
</p>
<p>
    Emphasis should be placed on proving the architecture with working software. If the solution is similar to a system
    produced previously (or is a well-known solution domain) then it&nbsp;will probably&nbsp;be good&nbsp;enough to
    reference that example as evidence of the feasibility of the approach. In some cases, it may be necessary to develop
    one or more prototypes to validate some of the decisions or clarify some of the requirements.
</p>
<p>
    The conclusion of this work should produce just enough information to communicate the architecture to the team and
    demonstrate its viability to the customer so that the project can move forward,&nbsp;enabling&nbsp;the
    architecture&nbsp;to be refined and baselined.

the test and aid collaboration with other team members.

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Explain the pre-conditions that must be met before running this Test Script. Use temporary test data or put parameters&#xD;
    in your script for data values. Ensure that each post-condition in the Test Case is evaluated by steps in the Test&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If the Test Script uses a dataset (such as a file or database), add the new test data to it and parameterize the Test&#xD;

    This applies to both manual and automated scripts.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Identify and minimize dependencies between test data used or modified by other Test Scripts. Note dependencies in the&#xD;
    Test Script.&#xD;

    Select test scripts related to work items completed in the build.&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    Ideally, each test cycle should execute all test scripts, but some types of tests are too time-consuming to include in&#xD;
    each test cycle. For manual or time-intensive tests, include test scripts that will provide the most useful feedback&#xD;
    about the maturing solution based on the objectives of the iteration.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Plan with test suites to&amp;nbsp;simplify the process of selecting tests for each build (see &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot; href=&quot;./../../openup/guidances/guidelines/test_suite_D54EEBED.html&quot; guid=&quot;_0aDz0MlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw&quot;>Guideline: Test Suite&lt;/a>).&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For automated test scripts, initiate the test execution.&amp;nbsp;Automated test scripts should run in suites in the&#xD;
    correct sequence, and collect results in the Test Log.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    To execute a manual test script, establish its preconditions, perform the steps while logging results in the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../openup/workproducts/test_log_CBA2FDF4.html&quot; guid=&quot;_0ZlSsMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw&quot;>Test Log&lt;/a>,&#xD;

                <Description>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Post the test results in a conspicuous place that is accessible to the entire team, such as a white board or wiki.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For each failing test script, analyze the Test Log to identify the cause of the test failure. Begin with failing tests&#xD;
    that you expected to begin passing against this build, which may indicate newly delivered work items that do not meet&#xD;
    the conditions of satisfaction. Then review previously passing test scripts that are now failing, which may indicate&#xD;
    regressive issues in the build.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        If a test failed because the solution does not meet the conditions of satisfaction for the test case, log the issue&#xD;
        in the Work Items List. In the work item, clearly identify the observed behavior, the expected behavior, and steps&#xD;
        to repeat the issue. Note which failing test initially discovered the issue.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        If a test failed because of a change in the system (such as a user-interface change), but the implementation still&#xD;
        meets the conditions of satisfaction in the test case, update the test script to pass with the new implementation.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        If a test failed because the test script is incorrect (a false negative result) or passed when it was expected to&#xD;
        fail (a false positive result), update the test script to correctly implement the conditions of satisfaction in the&#xD;
        test case. If the test case for a requirement is invalid, perform the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot; href=&quot;./../../openup/tasks/request_change_A048C387.html&quot; guid=&quot;_0mwzEclgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw&quot;>Task: Request Change&lt;/a> to&#xD;
        modify the conditions of satisfaction for the requirement.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It''s best to update test scripts as quickly and continuously as possible (see &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot; href=&quot;./../../openup/tasks/implement_test_scripts_26F00282.html&quot; guid=&quot;_0jO98MlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw&quot;>Task: Implement Test Scripts&lt;/a>). If the change to the test script is trivial, update the test while analyzing the test results. If the&#xD;
    change is a non-trivial task, submit it to the Work Items List so it can be prioritized against other tasks.&#xD;

                <Description>&lt;p>&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        How to partition the software when managing development (the use of layering as a partitioning strategy, for&#xD;
        example).&#xD;

    project and then prioritize the development of those that need to be&amp;nbsp;delivered to achieve the goals of the current&#xD;
    iteration. See &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot; href=&quot;./../../openup/guidances/concepts/arch_mech_2932DFB6.html&quot; guid=&quot;_mzxI0A4LEduibvKwrGxWxA&quot;>Concept: Architectural Mechanism&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;understand what architecture&#xD;

                <Description>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Identify the key abstractions that the system needs to handle. These can usually be found&amp;nbsp;by looking for nouns&#xD;
    that the requirements emphasize or repeat, because they help identify what is important to the business. The &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../openup/workproducts/glossary_5D300778.html&quot; guid=&quot;_Wn7HcNcEEdqz_d2XWoVt6Q&quot;>Glossary&lt;/a>&#xD;
    is also a useful source for key abstractions as it is itself a list of business nouns. Not all nouns will be key&#xD;
    abstractions in the system though, so work with the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../openup/roles/analyst_39D7C49B.html&quot; guid=&quot;_0VxJsMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw&quot;>Analyst&lt;/a> and &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../openup/roles/stakeholder_9FFD4106.html&quot; guid=&quot;_dTa6gMAYEdqX-s4mWhkyqQ&quot;>Stakeholder&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;as they will&#xD;

              <MainDescription><![CDATA[<h3>
    Introduction
</h3>
<p>
    Run this activity as a way to perform a goal-based planning and execution. Work is taken on by developers and work
    progress is tracked based on the goals achieved using the designed, developer-tested, and integrated source code.
</p>
<h4>
    Context of what is being developed
</h4>
<p>
    A context can be specified when a requirement is assigned to be developed, thus specifying how broadly a requirement is
    to be developed in a iteration. Development may focus on a layer (such as the user interface, business logic, or
    database access), on a component, and so on.
</p>
<p>
    Whether a context is specified or not, the developer''s responsibility is to create a design and implementation for that
    requirement, and also to write and run developer tests against the implementation to make sure it works as designed,
    both as a unit and integrated into the code base.
</p>
<h4>
    Overview of workflow
</h4>
<p>
    Typical changes require some effort in designing the solution before moving into the implementation, even if it is only
    a mental exercise that results in no long-term work product. Trivial changes to the existing implementation to support
    some requirement might have their design self-evident in the context of the existing architecture and design.
</p>
<p>
    Once the organization of the technical solution is clear, developer tests are defined that will verify the
    implementation. This test-driven approach enforces that design considerations have been done before the solution is
    coded. The tests are run up front and, in failing, clearly define the criteria to determine if the implementation works
    as intended.
</p>
<p>
    Failed tests lead to the implementation of the solution which upon completion causes the tests to be run again. This
    innermost loop is repeated until the tests pass.
</p>
<p>
    Passing the tests does not necessarily mean that the solution is a high-quality, appropriate solution. It is proper to
    revisit the design at this point. That path loops back through the process since any changes to the design could affect
    the developer tests and implementation.
</p>
<p>
    Once the tests are passing and the design of the solution is deemed appropriate, there is one more possible loopback.
    It is best to keep the test-driven, evolutionary design inner loops as tight as possible. Come up with some small-scale
    design solution for a part of the work item, define a test or two for the implementation of one part of the solution,
    pass that test, verify the quality, and then continue on in a test-first manner until that part of the design is
    working. Then in the outermost loop go back to the work item and design another chunk to get closer to completion.

              <UsageNotes><![CDATA[<p>
    This activity occurs multiple times during each iteration. Usually, there is one instance for each work item planned
    for that iteration. When instantiated in a project plan, the pattern becomes a development task to be taken on by one
    or more developers, and it should be renamed to include the actual requirement name. Optionally, the word
    <strong>Solution</strong> may be suppressed, then you can instantiate the pattern this way:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p align="left">
        Develop requirement_name (within context_name context)
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
    If a context is specified, there will be one instance of this pattern for each requirement for each context.
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        <strong>Example</strong>
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Develop scenario 1 (within user interface context)
        </li>
        <li>
            Develop scenario 1 (within business logic and DB access context)
        </li>
        <li>
            Develop scenario 2
        </li>
        <li>
            Develop supplemental requirement 1
        </li>
    </ol>
</blockquote>
<p>
    Note that there are four instances of this pattern in the preceding example:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The first two are related to the same requirement (scenario 1) but within two different contexts
    </li>
    <li>
        The last two are related to different requirements, with no context specified.
    </li>
</ul>]]></UsageNotes>

                <Description>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Identify the elements that collaborate together to provide the required behavior. This can start with the key&#xD;
    abstractions identified in the Architecture Notebook, design, domain analysis, and classical analysis of the&#xD;
    requirements (noun filtering) to derive the elements that would be required to fulfill them. The &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../openup/guidances/guidelines/entity_control_boundary_pattern_C4047897.html&quot; guid=&quot;_uF-QYEAhEdq_UJTvM1DM2Q&quot;>Entity-Control-Boundary Pattern&lt;/a> provides a good start for identifying elements. Also&#xD;
    see &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot; href=&quot;./../../openup/guidances/guidelines/analyze_the_design_4C4750C0.html&quot; guid=&quot;__MnggPTdEduDKIuqTXQ8SA&quot;>Guideline: Analyze the Design&lt;/a>.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Existing elements of the design should be examined to see if they should participate in the collaboration. It is a&#xD;
    mistake to create all new elements in each execution of this task.&#xD;

              <Step name="Determine how elements collaborate to realize the scenario" briefDescription="" id="_A_LU8KuLEdmhFZtkg1nakg" orderingGuide="" presentationName="" suppressed="false" sectionName="" variabilityType="na">
                <Description>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Walk through the scenario distributing responsibilities to the participating elements and ensuring that the elements&#xD;
    have the relationships required to collaborate.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    These responsibilities can be simple statements of behavior assigned to elements; they need not be detailed operation&#xD;
    specifications with parameters, etc. Similarly, the relationships can just be defined at this step. This step is about&#xD;
    ensuring that a quality model is being created that is robust enough to support the requirements. See &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot; href=&quot;./../../openup/guidances/guidelines/analyze_the_design_4C4750C0.html&quot; guid=&quot;__MnggPTdEduDKIuqTXQ8SA&quot;>Guideline: Analyze the Design&lt;/a>.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Look to the Architecture Notebook and previous design work to create a consistent collaboration. Work with the&#xD;
    architect to understand the details and motivations of the architecture. Look to reuse existing behavior and relations&#xD;
    or to apply similar structure to simplify the design of the overall system.&#xD;

&#xD;
&#xD;
    Refine the design to an appropriate level of detail to drive implementation and to ensure that it fits into the&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
    architecture. In this step the design can take into consideration the actual implementation language and other&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
    technical decisions. Revisit the identification of the elements and the collaborations that realize the scenarios if&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
    necessary as this refinement takes into consideration details at a lower level of abstraction. Discuss testability&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
    issues, such as design elements that are difficult to test or critical performance areas, with the tester and&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
    architect.&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
    Evolve the design by examining recent changes in the larger context of the design and determine if refactoring and&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
    redesigning techniques will improve the robustness, flexibility, and understandability of the design.

&#xD;
    Design large or complex elements or some complex internal behavior in more detail.&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
    This might just involve devising an algorithm that could be performed to produce the desired behavior. Add additional&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
    operations, attributes, and relationships to support the expectations of an element.&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
    Design the state of the element over the course of its lifetime to ensure its proper behavior in various circumstances.&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
    It may be useful to describe a state machine for elements with complex states.&#xD;

                <Description>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Communicate&amp;nbsp;the system''s design to&amp;nbsp;those who need to understand it. Though this is described here toward the&#xD;
    end of the task, communication should be going on throughout the steps. Working collaboratively is always better than&#xD;
    reviewing the work after it is complete.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Here are some ways to communicate&amp;nbsp;the design:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Formal models&amp;nbsp;specified in UML.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Informal diagrams that render static structure and capture&amp;nbsp;dynamic behavior.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Annotated code that communicates information about the static structure. This can be&amp;nbsp;supplemented with textual&#xD;
        descriptions of collaborative behavior across code modules.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Data models to describe the database schema.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Here are some examples of individuals&amp;nbsp;who will need to understand the design of the system:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Developers&amp;nbsp;who will implement a solution based on the design.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Architects who can review the design to ensure that it conforms to the architecture or who might examine the design&#xD;
        for opportunities to improve the architecture.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Other designers who can examine the design for applicability to other parts of the system.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Developers or other designers who will be working on other parts of the system that will&amp;nbsp;depend on the&#xD;
        elements designed in this task.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Other reviewers&amp;nbsp;who will review the design for quality and adherence to standards.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;

&#xD;
    Consider the design from various angles to ensure that it is a high-quality, communicable design. Work with other&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
    technical team members; an independent party can provide a fresh perspective. Use the tester and architect to provide&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
    perspectives on design quality and adherence to the architecture. However, when identifying potential reviewers keep in&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
    mind that if someone can add value by reviewing the design, then perhaps they could have added even more value by&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
    actively participating in the design effort itself. If design flaws are identified, improve the design.&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Even without tools, there is&amp;nbsp;typically some amount of code that can be created by rote by examining the design and&#xD;

                <Description>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Write the source code to make the implementation conform to the design and expected behavior. You should strive to&#xD;
    reuse and/or generate code wherever possible, but you will still need to do some programming. To do so, consider the&#xD;
    following:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Examine the&amp;nbsp;requirements. Because some requirements information does not translate directly into your design&#xD;
        you should examine the requirement(s) to ensure that they are fully realized in the implementation.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Refactor your code to improve its design. &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
        href=&quot;./../../openup/guidances/concepts/refactoring.html&quot; guid=&quot;_Poc7IPDzEdqYgerqi84oCA&quot;>Refactoring&lt;/a> is a&#xD;
        technique where you improve the quality of your code via small, safe changes.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Tune the results of the existing implementation by improving performance, the user interface, security, and other&#xD;
        nonfunctional areas.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Add missing details, such as completing the logic of operations or adding supporting classes and data structures&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Handle boundary conditions.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Deal with unusual circumstances or error states.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Restrict behavior (preventing users or client code from executing illegal flows, scenarios, or combinations of&#xD;
        options).&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Add critical sections for multi-threaded or re-entrant code.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Though many different considerations are listed here, there is one clear way to know when the source code is done. The&#xD;
    solution has been implemented when it passes the developer tests. Any other considerations can be taken care of in a&#xD;
    refactoring pass over the code to improve it once it is complete and correct.&#xD;
&lt;/p></Description>
              </Step>
              <Step name="Evaluate the Implementation" briefDescription="" id="_ni25UKuPEdmhFZtkg1nakg" orderingGuide="" presentationName="" suppressed="false" sectionName="" variabilityType="na">
                <Description>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Verify that the implementation is fit for its purpose. Examine the code for its suitability to perform its intended&#xD;
    function. This is a quality assurance step that you perform in addition to testing which is described in other tasks.&#xD;
    Consider these strategies:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Pair programming. By pairing to implement the code in the first place, you effectively evaluate the code as its&#xD;
        being written.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Read through the code for common mistakes. Consider keeping a checklist of common mistakes that you make, as a&#xD;
        reminder reference.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Use tools to check for implementation errors and inappropriate code. For example, use a static code rule checker or&#xD;
        set the compiler to the most detailed warning level.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Use tools that can visualize the code. Code visualization, such as the UML visualizations in the Eclipse IDE, help&#xD;
        developers identify issues such as excessive coupling or circular dependencies.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Perform informal, targeted code inspections. Ask colleagues to review small critical sections of code and code with&#xD;
        significant churn. Avoid reviewing large sections of code.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Use&amp;nbsp;a tester to ensure the implementation is testable and understandable to testing resources.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Improve the implementation based on the results of these evaluations.&#xD;
&lt;/p></Description>

              <Step name="Communicate significant decisions" briefDescription="" id="_q5XiIKuPEdmhFZtkg1nakg" orderingGuide="" presentationName="" suppressed="false" sectionName="" variabilityType="na">
                <Description>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Communicate the impact of unexpected changes to the design and requirements.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The issues and constraints that you uncover when you implement the system must be communicated to the team. The impact&#xD;
    of issues discovered during implementation must be incorporated into future decisions. If appropriate, update&#xD;
    requirements to reflect ambiguities that you identified and resolved in the implementation so they can be tested and&#xD;
    you can manage the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../openup/roles/stakeholder.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;_dTa6gMAYEdqX-s4mWhkyqQ&quot;>Stakeholder&lt;/a> expectations appropriately. Similarly, update the design to reflect new&#xD;
    constraints and issues uncovered during implementation to be sure that the new information is communicated to other&#xD;
    developers.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Usually, there is no need for a change request if the required change is small and the same person is designing and&#xD;
    implementing the code element. That individual can make the design change directly. If the required change has a broad&#xD;
    impact, it may be necessary to communicate that change to the other team members through a change request.&#xD;

    Run the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../openup/workproducts/developer_test_8470ED13.html&quot; guid=&quot;_0YuXEclgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw&quot;>Developer Test&lt;/a>s. The procedure will vary, depending on whether the test is manual or&#xD;
    automated and whether additional test components are necessary,&amp;nbsp;such as&amp;nbsp;drivers or stubs.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    To run the tests, you need to make sure that you have initialized the test environment with all necessary elements,&#xD;
    such as software, hardware, tools, data, and so on.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Automated tests will often update a &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../openup/workproducts/test_log_CBA2FDF4.html&quot; guid=&quot;_0ZlSsMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw&quot;>Test Log&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;which you can evaluate to determine where your tests went wrong.&#xD;

    Evaluate the test execution by analyzing the test run.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Testing will&amp;nbsp;complete either&amp;nbsp;normally or abnormally.&amp;nbsp; For correctly implemented tests, a normal&#xD;
    completion represents a passed test, though it could warrant additional examination of the test log to ensure&amp;nbsp;the&#xD;
    test&amp;nbsp;ran as expected.&amp;nbsp; Abnormal termination could be premature termination or just a test that does not&#xD;
    complete as intended.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Review the test log to understand any reported failures, warnings, or unexpected results. The cause of the problem(s)&#xD;
    might be that the implementation element being tested is faulty, a problem with the developer tests, or a problem with&#xD;
    the environment.&#xD;
&lt;/p></Description>

                <Description>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Determine the appropriate corrective action to recover from a &quot;failed&quot; developer test run. If the implementation&#xD;
    element under test is faulty, fix the problem if possible and rerun the tests. If the problem is serious and cannot be&#xD;
    immediately addressed, perform the task &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../openup/tasks/request_change_A048C387.html&quot; guid=&quot;_0mwzEclgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw&quot;>Request Change&lt;/a> to report the defect. If the developer test is faulty fix the test and rerun the tests. If there was a&#xD;
    problem with the environment, resolve it and then rerun&amp;nbsp;the tests.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    When the developer tests pass, communicate the results. If the passing of these tests represent completion of a&#xD;
    requirement, this could involve updating the status of something on the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../openup/workproducts/work_items_list_39D03CC8.html&quot; guid=&quot;_rGNWsCbSEdqh1LYUOGRh2A&quot;>Work Items List&lt;/a>.&#xD;

            <MainDescription><![CDATA[<h3>
    Introduction
</h3>
<p>
    Most activities during a typical iteration in Elaboration phase happen in parallel. Essentially, the main objectives
    for Elaboration are related to better understanding the requirements, creating and establishing a baseline for the
    architecture for the system, and mitigating top-priority risks.
</p>
<p>
    The activities performed in a typical iteration during&nbsp;the Elaboration phase are described below.
</p>
<h4>
    Manage iteration
</h4>
<p>
    This activity is performed throughout the project lifecycle. The goal of this activity is to identify risks and issues
    early enough that they can be mitigated, to establish the goals for the iteration, and to support the development team
    in reaching these goals.
</p>
<p>
    The <a class="elementlinkwithusertext" href="./../../openup_basic/roles/project_manager.html" guid="_0a0o0MlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">project manager</a> and the team launche the iteration, allocating work items to team
    members (some project teams will prefer to have members volunteer to perform work). The project manager collaborates
    with the team to break down the work items into development tasks to perform in that iteration. This provides a more
    accurate estimate of time to spend on what can be realistically achieved.
</p>
<p>
    As the iteration runs, the project manager performs monitoring and control of&nbsp;the project by regularly checking
    the status of work completed, the work to do next, and issues blocking the progress<strong>.</strong> In some projects,
    this checking occurs in daily meetings, which allows for a&nbsp;more precise&nbsp;understanding of how the work in an
    iteration is progressing. As needed, the&nbsp;team makes corrections to achieve what was planned. The overall idea is
    that risks and issues are identified and managed throughout the iteration. and everyone knows the project status.
</p>
<p>
    The prioritization of work for a given iteration takes place. Project manager,&nbsp;<a class="elementlinkwithusertext" href="./../../openup_basic/roles/stakeholder.html" guid="_dTa6gMAYEdqX-s4mWhkyqQ">stakeholders</a>, and the remaining team members agree on what is supposed to be
    developed during that iteration.
</p>
<p>
    As in any other iteration assessment, demonstration of implemented functionality planned for that iteration is the key
    success criterion. During iteration assessments in Elaboration, though, keep the phase objectives in mind. As
    Elaboration iterations are performed, an executable architecture evolves, and you establish a baseline at the end of
    the phase. In addition, requirements are better understood and detailed. Essential risks, including the architectural
    ones, have been mitigated. These results&nbsp;help the project manager produce more accurate estimates for the project
    schedule and cost.
</p>
<h4>
    Manage requirements
</h4>
<p>
    This activity is repeated throughout the project lifecycle. The goal of this activity is to understand and prioritize
    stakeholder needs and associated requirements for the system, and also to capture these in a form that supports
    effective communication and collaboration between the stakeholders and development team.
</p>
<p>
    During the Elaboration phase, requirements can still be captured and outlined as customer needs arise. The
    prioritization of requirements determines when new requirements are going to be implemented. High-risk, architecturally
    significant requirements are detailed to the extent necessary to be able to use that information as input to
    architecture and development activities in the current iteration, plus in planning for the next iteration.
</p>
<p>
    <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../openup_basic/workproducts/test_case-2.html" guid="_0ZS-0MlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">Test cases</a> describe which&nbsp;requirements are being tested&nbsp;in that iteration.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Note:<br />
    <br />
    </strong> The emphasis on finding, outlining and detailing requirements varies from phase to phase. Iterations in
    Inception and early Elaboration tend to focus more on identifying and outlining requirements in general and on
    detailing high-priority and architecturally significant requirements. During iterations in late Elaboration and early
    Construction, the remaining requirements are usually outlined and detailed.
</p>
<h4>
    Define the architecture
</h4>
<p>
    This activity is repeated in each iteration in the Elaboration phase. The main&nbsp;goal of this activity is&nbsp;to
    propose an <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../openup_basic/workproducts/architecture.html" guid="_0XAf0MlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">architecture</a> that addresses the requirements with high architectural risks, thus
    providing a solid, yet resilient, foundation on which to build the system functionality.
</p>
<p>
    The <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../openup_basic/roles/architect.html" guid="_0X9iEMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">architect</a> analyzes the architectural constraints, identifies available assets to
    build the system, defines how the system will be structured, and identifies the initial abstractions and mechanisms
    that must be provided by the architecture.
</p>
<p>
    Throughout all of the iterations, the architect:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Identifies commonalities between different requirements to leverage reuse
    </li>
    <li>
        Defines strategies for achieving requirements related to quality
    </li>
    <li>
        Captures and communicates architectural decisions
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    Develop solution for requirement within context
</h4>
<p>
    This activity is instantiated multiple times, in parallel, for each development task planned for that iteration. The
    main goal of this activity is an executable system that provides the incremental quality and functionality for the
    specified requirements within the specified context.
</p>
<p>
    As the requirements planned for the iteration are broken down into development tasks, these are assigned by the project
    managers to <a class="elementlinkwithusertext" href="./../../openup_basic/roles/developer.html" guid="_0YDosMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">developers</a> (some project teams prefer to have team members sign up for development
    tasks themselves).
</p>
<p>
    The solution to be developed is for a particular requirement within a context, which reflects the idea of breaking down
    requirements into development tasks. As an example, a particular use-case scenario within the context of database
    access could be assigned to a developer; whereas, the same scenario within the user interface and business logic
    contexts could be assigned to a different developer. In this example, more than one developer is working on a
    particular piece of functionality to be delivered in a particular iteration. As they develop the requirement within the
    context they were assigned to, they perform&nbsp;<a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../openup_basic/workproducts/developer_test.html" guid="_0YuXEclgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">tests</a> and integrate their work to create <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../openup_basic/workproducts/build.html" guid="_0YuXEMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">builds</a>.
</p>
<h4>
    Validate build
</h4>
<p>
    This activity is repeated throughout the project lifecycle. The main goal of this activity is to validate the current
    increment of the system against the requirements allocated to it.
</p>
<p>
    The intent is to validate that the high-priority requirements implemented reflect a robust architecture so that
    remaining requirements can be implemented on top of that architecture. As developer develop the solution for the
    requirements in a given iteration, the integrated source code is unit-tested. Then, a separate <a class="elementlinkwithusertext" href="./../../openup_basic/roles/tester.html" guid="_0ZM4MclgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">tester</a> conducts system-level testing in parallel with development to make sure that
    the solution, which is continuously being integrated, matches what is specified in the requirements. Then, the tester
    defines what techniques to use, what the data input is, what <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../openup_basic/guidances/guidelines/test_suite.html" guid="_0aDz0MlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">test suites</a> to create. As tests are performed, defects found are reported and added

<h4>
    Ongoing tasks
</h4>
<p>
    This activity includes tasks that happen throughout the iteration on an ongoing basis but are not necessarily part of a
    plan. For example, at any time, <a class="elementlinkwithusertext" href="./../../openup_basic/roles/any_role.html" guid="_0dsWoMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">any role</a> in
    the project team can issue a <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../openup_basic/guidances/concepts/change_requests.html" guid="_6jdvECb3Edqh1LYUOGRh2A">change request</a>, either because there are requests for enhancements, or defects are
    found. These change requests are part of the work items list and are prioritized and assigned to team members. Anyone
    can be assigned to make changes that develop enhancements or fix defects.

            <MainDescription><![CDATA[<h3>
    Introduction&nbsp;
</h3>
<p>
    In the Transition phase, most activities happen in parallel. The main objectives are to fine-tune functionality,
    performance, and overall quality of the beta product from the end of Construction phase.
</p>
<p>
    The activities performed in a typical iteration during the&nbsp;Transition phase are described below.
</p>
<h4>
    Manage iteration
</h4>
<p>
    This activity is performed throughout the lifecycle. The goal of this activity is to identify risks and issues early
    enough that they can be mitigated, to establish the goals for the iteration, and to support the development team in
    reaching these goals.
</p>
<p>
    Similar to other phases, this is an activity led by the <a class="elementlinkwithusertext" href="./../../openup_basic/roles/project_manager.html" guid="_0a0o0MlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">project
    manager</a> (in collaboration with the team) to launch the iteration, to allocate work, to track status, and to handle
    risks and issues. It’s unlikely that risks of high impact will happen during the Transition, but it is recommended that
    the project manager and team identify any potential issues&nbsp;while delivering the product to the end users.
</p>
<p>
    If this is the last iteration of the project, the main goal is to achieve final acceptance of the system. At the end of
    the iteration, results are assessed against phase objectives<em>,</em> and <a class="elementlinkwithusertext" href="./../../openup_basic/roles/stakeholder.html" guid="_dTa6gMAYEdqX-s4mWhkyqQ">stakeholders''</a> concurrence on the project objectives is obtained. The team conducts a
    retrospective review to capture lessons learned and make improvements to the process for subsequent projects. The
    project is then closed.
</p>
<h4>
    Ongoing tasks
</h4>
<p>
    Submission of change requests during the Transition phase works&nbsp;differently than in other phases. New requirements
    will rarely be identified at late stages of the software development lifecycle in a way they can be implemented in the
    current release. If there are enhancement requests, though, they can be captured in the <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../openup_basic/workproducts/work_items_list.html" guid="_rGNWsCbSEdqh1LYUOGRh2A">work items list</a> and allocated to a future release, when a new software development
    lifecycle begins. In that case, requirements will be outlined and detailed accordingly.
</p>
<p>
    However, defects are typically dealt with during the Transition phase,&nbsp;thus a stable release can be accepted by
    the user community. If there is general agreement from stakeholders, correction of low-priority defects can be
    postponed to subsequent evolutionary releases.
</p>
<h4>
    Develop solution for requirement within context
</h4>
<p>
    This activity is repeated multiple times, in parallel, for each development task planned for that iteration. The main
    goal of this activity is an executable system that provides the incremental quality and functionality for the specified
    requirements within the specified context.
</p>
<p>
    During the Transition phase, most requirements will have been already implemented and validated, which is the focus of
    the previous phase. Nevertheless, there may be a few low-priority requirements that could be accommodated in the
    release being developed. However, enhancement requests and defects found in previous iterations may need to be
    allocated to <a class="elementlinkwithusertext" href="./../../openup_basic/roles/developer.html" guid="_0YDosMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">developers</a>.
</p>
<h4>
    Validate build
</h4>
<p>
    This activity is repeated throughout the lifecycle. The main goal of this activity is to validate the current increment
    of the system against the requirements allocated to it.
</p>
<p>
    This activity happens in parallel with development of the solutions for enhancement requests and defects (and possibly
    remaining requirements), to make sure that a stable release can be presented to the user community. Users can be
    involved in performing <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../openup_basic/capabilitypatterns/test-2.html" guid="_0nz79clgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">tests</a> to accept the release.

            <MainDescription><![CDATA[<h3>
    Introduction
</h3>Iterations in Construction phase have a work breakdown structure (WBS) similar to iterations in the Elaboration phase,
with activities happening in parallel. There is a different&nbsp;emphasis on how activities&nbsp;address the phase
objectives, though. 
<p>
    The <a href="./../../openup_basic/workproducts/architecture.html" guid="_0XAf0MlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">architecture</a> is expected to be stable when this phase starts, allowing the remaining
    requirements to be implemented on top of it. Another advantage of validating the architecture and eliminating as many
    risks as possible during Elaboration is to provide more predictability in Construction, which allows the <a class="elementlinkwithusertext" href="./../../openup_basic/roles/project_manager.html" guid="_0a0o0MlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">project manager</a> to focus on team efficiency and cost reduction.
</p>
<p>
    Functionality is continuously implemented, tested, and integrated, resulting in <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../openup_basic/workproducts/build.html" guid="_0YuXEMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">builds</a>
    that are more and more complete and stable. A beta or prerelease may be deployed to a sampling of the intended audience
    at the end of Construction. Delivery of the actual release is the main focus of the next phase.
</p>
<p>
    The activities performed in a typical iteration during&nbsp;Construction phase are described after the following
    introductions to each activity.
</p>
<h4>
    Manage iteration
</h4>
<p>
    This activity is performed throughout the project lifecycle. The goal of this activity is to identify risks and issues
    early enough to mitigate them, to establish the goals for the iteration, and to support the development team in
    reaching these goals.
</p>
<p>
    Similarly to other phases, the project manager (supported by the team) launches the iteration, allocates work, tracks
    status, and handles issues and risks. Although the high-priority and architecturally significant risks were mitigated
    during Elaboration, new risks may appear during Construction, such as not having the right amount of resources to
    obtain the desired degree of parallel&nbsp;development.
</p>
<p>
    The prioritization of work for a given iteration (existing change requests and possibly a few remaining requirements)
    takes place. project manager,&nbsp;<a class="elementlinkwithusertext" href="./../../openup_basic/roles/stakeholder.html" guid="_dTa6gMAYEdqX-s4mWhkyqQ">stakeholders</a>, and the remaining team members agree on what is supposed to be
    developed during that iteration.
</p>
<p>
    At the end of the iteration, the team performs an iteration assessment. The goal is to conduct a retrospective review
    of the iteration that is ending. As part of this assessment, the objectives for the Construction phase are expected to
    be demonstrated by the beta-quality release of the software, thus supporting the possibility of transitioning the
    software to its end users.
</p>
<h4>
    Manage requirements
</h4>
<p>
    This activity is repeated throughout the lifecycle. The goal of this activity is to understand and prioritize
    stakeholder needs and associated requirements for the system, as well as to capture these in a form that will support
    effective communication and collaboration between the stakeholders and the development team.
</p>
<p>
    During Inception, most requirements are captured. The high-risk requirements are detailed, implemented, and validated
    (through a working architecture) during Elaboration.
</p>
<p>
    During the Construction phase, requirements management demands less time from the <a class="elementlinkwithusertext" href="./../../openup_basic/roles/analyst.html" guid="_0VxJsMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">analyst</a>.
    There still may be low-risk requirements to be detailed or refined, but in a way that can be assigned to <a class="elementlinkwithusertext" href="./../../openup_basic/roles/developer.html" guid="_0YDosMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">developers</a>.
</p>
<p>
    <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../openup_basic/workproducts/test_case-2.html" guid="_0ZS-0MlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">Test cases</a> describe which&nbsp;requirements are being tested&nbsp;in that iteration.
</p>
<h4>
    Develop solution
</h4>
<p>
    This activity is repeated multiple times, in parallel, for each development task planned for that iteration. The main
    goal of this activity is an executable system that provides the incremental quality and functionality for the specified
    requirements, within the specified context.
</p>
<p>
    The architecture &nbsp;was proposed and a baseline established at the end of Elaboration. Critical requirements were
    expected to be implemented, tested, and integrated as part of the baseline architecture. As the remaining requirements
    are implemented during Construction, the Architect identifies commonalities among solutions being developed by the
    various developers and leverages reuse where possible. Some degree of refactoring of the architecture may be needed to
    accommodate putting common pieces together.
</p>
<p>
    A pattern similar to the Elaboration phase happens during Construction when it comes to breaking down requirements into
    development tasks and assigning each requirement within a context to a developer. Requirements at this stage are mostly
    of medium-to-low level of risk, but usually they represent the largest slice from the total amount of requirements to
    be implemented in a project. Thus, it is expected that this activity is repeated, or instantiated, multiple times (once
    per requirement within context),&nbsp;thus allowing&nbsp;parallel development. <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../openup_basic/guidances/guidelines/continuous_integration.html" guid="_i8bUEL6cEdqti4GwqTkbsQ">Continuous integration</a> allows functionality to be added to the code base constantly,
    which helps the achievement of more and more complete <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../openup_basic/workproducts/build.html" guid="_0YuXEMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">builds</a>
    of the software.
</p>
<h4>
    Validate build
</h4>
<p>
    This activity is repeated throughout the project lifecycle. The main goal of this activity is to validate the current
    increment of the system against the requirements allocated to it.
</p>
<p>
    Similarly to Elaboration, this activity happens in parallel with the <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../openup_basic/capabilitypatterns/develop_solution-2.html" guid="_h2-iAfimEdmugcVr9AdHjQ">develop solution</a> activity. The intent is to validate that a stable beta release is
    achieved and that users can perform acceptance tests.
</p>
<h4>
    Ongoing tasks
</h4>
<p>
    Similarly to any other phase, <a class="elementlinkwithusertext" href="./../../openup_basic/roles/any_role.html" guid="_0dsWoMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">any role</a> on
    the team can submit <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../openup_basic/guidances/guidelines/change_requests-2.html" guid="_fnZj0NVXEdqy9sbRhejO5Q">change requests</a>. The software being developed is achieving beta quality by this
    point; therefore, defects of high priority&nbsp;are generally&nbsp;addressed during Construction iterations&nbsp;and
    Transition iterations. Enhancement requests can be planned for either subsequent Transition iterations or a next
    release of the product.

    Introduction
</h3>
<p>
    Project managers use this Capability Pattern&nbsp;as a way to&nbsp;perform a goal-based planning and management. Work
    is assigned to developers and work progress is tracked&nbsp;based on the goals to be achieved using the designed,
    unit-tested, and&nbsp;integrated&nbsp;source code.
</p>
<h4>
    Context of what is being developed
</h4>
<p>
    A context can be specified when a requirement is assigned to be developed, thus specifying how broadly a requirement is
    to be developed in a iteration. Development&nbsp;may focus&nbsp;on a layer (such as the user interface, business logic,
    or&nbsp;database access),&nbsp;on a component, and so on.
</p>
<p>
    Whether a context is specified or not, the developer''s responsibility is to create a design and implementation for that
    requirement, then to&nbsp;write and run unit tests against the implementation to make sure the&nbsp;implementation
    works as designed, both as a unit&nbsp;and&nbsp;integrated into the code base.
</p>
<h4>
    Overview of workflow
</h4>
<p>
    To accommodate major changes or&nbsp;major functionality to be developed, architecture may have to be refined. Small
    changes and functionality may reflect changes on the design only, with no need to refine the architecture. For trivial
    changes and functionality to be developed, only the source code may be affected.
</p>
<p>
    In any case, there is no strict sequence for how writing code and creating or running &nbsp;developer tests should
    happen, because they can happen in parallel.&nbsp;You may choose to create and run developer tests before the actual
    code is created or the reverse sequence.

              <UsageNotes><![CDATA[<p>
    This Capability Pattern occurs multiple times during each iteration. Usually, there is one instance for each
    requirement planned for that iteration. When instantiated in a project plan, the pattern becomes a development task to
    be assigned to a developer, and it should be renamed to include the actual requirement name.&nbsp;Optionally, the word
    <strong>Solution</strong> may be suppressed, then you can instantiate the pattern this way:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p align="left">
        Develop <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">requirement_name</font> (within <font         face="Courier New, Courier, mono">context_name</font> context)
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
    If&nbsp;a context&nbsp;is specified, there will be one instance of this pattern for each requirement&nbsp;for each
    context.
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        <strong>Example</strong>
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Develop <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">scenario 1</font> (within <font             face="Courier New, Courier, mono">user interface</font> context)
        </li>
        <li>
            Develop <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">scenario 1</font> (within <font             face="Courier New, Courier, mono">business logic and DB access</font> context)
        </li>
        <li>
            Develop <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">scenario 2</font>
        </li>
        <li>
            Develop <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">supplemental requirement 1</font>
        </li>
    </ol>
</blockquote>
<p>
    Note that there are four instances of this pattern in the preceding example:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The first two are related to the same requirement (scenario 1) but within two different contexts
    </li>
    <li>
        The last two are related to different requirements, with no context specified.
    </li>
</ul>]]></UsageNotes>

    OpenUP/Basic is an iterative process with <a class="elementlinkwithusertext" href="./../../openup_basic/guidances/concepts/core_principle_evolve.html" guid="_GXiogMvoEdqukPpotm3DYg">iterations</a>&nbsp;distributed throughout four <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../base_concepts/guidances/concepts/phase.html" guid="__7xOEC7aEdqHMdmRzC0-2g">phases</a>: <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../openup_basic/guidances/concepts/inception_phase.html" guid="_0hmKgBOMEduCNqgZdt_OaA">Inception</a>, <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../openup_basic/guidances/concepts/elaboration_phase.html" guid="_2plxwBOMEduCNqgZdt_OaA">Elaboration</a>, <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../openup_basic/guidances/concepts/construction_phase.html" guid="_48EKsBOMEduCNqgZdt_OaA">Construction</a>, and <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../openup_basic/guidances/concepts/transition_phase.html" guid="__ca5UBOMEduCNqgZdt_OaA">Transition</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Each phase may have as many iterations as needed, depending on degree of novelty of the business domain, technology
    being used, architectural complexity, and project size, to name a few factors.
</p>
<p>
    To offer a quick start for teams to plan their iterations,&nbsp;OpenUP/Basic provides&nbsp;work breakdown structure
    (WBS) templates for each iteration and a WBS template for an end-to-end process.
</p>
<p>
    Iterations may have variable lengths, depending on project characteristics. One-month iterations are typically
    recommended, because this timeframe provides:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        A reasonable amount of time for projects to deliver meaningful increments in functionality
    </li>
    <li>
        Early and frequent customer feedback
    </li>
    <li>
        Timely management of risks and issues during the course of the project
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    OpenUP/Basic is intended to offer process guidance to small projects:
</p>
